<h2>Second-Generation Books</h2>
<p>His most recent books have been focused on second-generation Android app development (Kotlin and the Android Jetpack):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/Jetpack"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Elements of Android Jetpack</em></a>, a new introductory book on Android app development, focused on second-generation techniques. Version 2.0 is available, with 898 pages, covering Android Studio 4.1.1 and up through Android 11.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/AndExplore"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Exploring Android</em></a>, a series of step-by-step tutorials for building an Android app from scratch. This book is being rewritten to demonstrate using Kotlin and the Jetpack libraries. Version 2.0 is available, with 34 tutorials spanning 610 pages.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/R"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Elements of Android R</em></a>, to help you deal with the changes introduced by Android 11 (code-named &quot;R&quot;). The final version is available, with 140 pages of material on everything from scoped storage changes to data access auditing to sharing UIs between apps to bubbles.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/Room"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Elements of Android Room</em></a>, to help you incorporate Google's reactive object wrapper around SQLite. Version 0.5 is available, comprising 244 pages.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/Kotlin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Elements of Kotlin</em></a>, a guide to the Kotlin programming language, which is rapidly gaining in popularity for Android app development. Version 1.0 is available, comprising 418 pages.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/Coroutines"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Elements of Kotlin Coroutines</em></a>, exploring Kotlin's new
first-class reactive programming system. Version 0.3 is available, comprising 244 pages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>First-Generation Books</h2>
<p>In the beginning, Android development was focused on Java and, partially, on the Android Support Library. Mark's earliest books share that focus:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/Android"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development</em></a>, the first and largest book on Android app programming</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/AndroidArch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Android's Architecture Components</em></a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/GraphQL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>GraphQL and Android</em></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Things Other Than Books</h2>
<p>He runs the <a href=""https://jetc.dev"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>jetc.dev</code></a> weekly newsletter for Jetpack Compose.</p>
<p>He also offers <a href=""https://commonsware.com/office-hours/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">office hours chats</a> and <a href=""https://commonsware.com/consulting"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">consulting</a> on Android app development, in case you are interested in help beyond what fits the Stack Overflow model, the books, and the training.</p>
<p>Heck, he even has <a href=""http://commonsware.com/blog"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a blog</a>.</p>

<p>I'm a software developer who relishes authoring HTML and CSS on the web and hacking C# on their self-built Windows PC. I adore Jesus and the colors green, purple and teal, and I often catch myself thinking in numbers and code on a whim. I was also a <a href=""https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5002751"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft MVP</a> from 2017 through 2020.</p>
<p>My areas of specialty are in web design ‚Äî I've known HTML and CSS for more than a decade now! ‚Äî and Windows app development with C# and XAML. Other languages I've worked with include (from most to least experience) PHP, SQL, ActionScript, Swift, Objective-C, Perl, Python, and Java.</p>
<h2>Roles on this site</h2>
<p>From the tags I participate in (below) as well as my bio (above), it's easy to tell that I'm interested in a number of languages and topics. However, you'll most often find me patrolling, curating and moderating the following tags:</p>
<p><a href=""/questions/tagged/html"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;html&#39;"" rel=""tag"">html</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/css"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;css&#39;"" rel=""tag"">css</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/css-selectors"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;css-selectors&#39;"" rel=""tag"">css-selectors</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/internet-explorer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;internet-explorer&#39;"" rel=""tag"">internet-explorer</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/microsoft-edge"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;microsoft-edge&#39;"" rel=""tag"">microsoft-edge</a></p>
<p>As a moderator, I believe I am more efficient than ever with post revisions and other housekeeping duties, as I continue with my question-answering business. While I actively add fresh content to the site, I'm also helping out with cleaning and polishing our currently-existing posts. &quot;Dust tends to settle&quot;, and all that jazz.</p>

<pre><code>Today I left my phone at home
And went down to the sea.
The sand was soft, the ocean glass,
But I was still just me.

Then pelicans in threes and fours,
Glided by like dinosaurs,
An otter basked upon its back,
And dived to find another snack.

The sun corpuscular and bright,
Cast down a piercing shaft,
And conjured an inspiring sight
On glinting, bobbing craft.

Two mermaids rose up from the reef,
Out of the breaking waves.
Their siren song was opium grief,
Their faces from the grave.

The mermaids asked a princely kiss
To free them from their spell.
I said to try a poet‚Äôs bliss.
They shrugged and bid farewell.

The sun grew dark and sinister,
In unscheduled eclipse.
As two eight-headed aliens
Descended in their ships.

They said the World was nice enough
But didn‚Äôt like our star.
And asked the way to Betelgeuse,
If it wouldn‚Äôt be too far.

Two whales breached far out to sea,
And flew up to the sky,
The crowd was busy frolicking,
And didn‚Äôt ask me why.

Today I left my phone at home,
On the worst day, you‚Äôll agree.
If only I had pictures,
If only you could see.

Not everything was really there,
I‚Äôm happy to confess,
But I still have the memories,
Worth more than tweets and stress.

Today I left my phone at home,
I had no shakes or sorrow.
If that is what my mind can do,
It stays at home tomorrow.
