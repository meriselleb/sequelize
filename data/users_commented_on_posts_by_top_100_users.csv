This led to the PC platform, an Amstrad 1512, where I learned various flavours of BASIC and 8086 programming, even doing some very rudimentary 3D graphics. Up until this point, everything had been self taught. </p>

<p>In 1988 I went to Bradford University to study for an Electronic / Software Engineering degree. This was a thin sandwich style course over four years, the first three were split six months at university and six months on placement in industry. The first year introduced the Pascal programming language and the Unix operating system at university and C during the placement. Subsequent years concentrated on C and assembly language for various platforms – mainly Motorola and Transputer based as well as Sun Unix systems.</p>

<p>Upon completing my degree I developed and had published my first PC game. This led the way to further jobs in the games industry and it wasn't long before C++ became the language of choice for work. In 2004 I began branching out on my own to work on business solutions. </p>

<p>My interest in programming goes beyond work related projects. I spend my spare time looking into new technologies and new languages. I have recently configured a linux server for my home network, built some small, personal websites and tools to update the databases that sit behind the sites. I purchased a Raspberry Pi which I use to develop linux based software using python, OpenGL|ES, etc., as well as building some electronic circuits to interface to the device.</p>

Voi wouldn't mind."" Voi is uncomfortable with the gender-specific pronouns 'he' and 'she', not because voi dislikes voids gender assigned at birth, but because it is irrelevant noise and none of anyone's business.</p>

<p>Furthermore, people are less like individuals and more like elements of a collective, certainly users at StackExchange sites. The use of dualistic pronouns like 'I', 'we' and 'you' do not reflect the transcendental nature of this site (and society as a whole). Voi therefore prefer to use voi/void/voids/voids/voidself also for first and second person pronouns.</p>

<p>Please use voi/void/voids/voids/voidself when referring to void. Not everyone has the same worldview, so it is not offending to void if voi uses other pronouns when referring to voidself. Voi will use preferred pronouns when referring to others if known.</p>

2.  A traditional rule governing the case of personal pronouns after forms of the verb to be  is that the nominative or subjective form ( I; she; he; we; they ) must be chosen. Some 400 years ago, owing to the feeling that the postverb position in a sentence is object rather than subject territory, me  and other objective pronouns ( him; her; us; them ) began to replace the subjective forms after be,  so that It is I  became It is me.</p>

But I can and will use whatever tool gets the job done, and I've had fun doing so with Angular, jQuery, ASP.NET, PHP, and even my own homemade frameworks to deliver solutions against that platform.</p>

<p>Before that, I worked here - at Stack Overflow / Stack Exchange. Here, my duties <em>also</em> involved helping a bunch of really skilled people share their knowledge. So you might encounter some posts from me which provide guidance and advice for the folks using this network of Q&amp;A sites.</p>
<p>I tend to write as though I know what I'm writing about... And sometimes I do... But, you should always use your own judgement: question everything, read the links to supporting materials, and draw your own conclusions. I'm usually happy to discuss anything I've written, so don't hesitate to raise concerns or point out when something is unclear!</p>

I love to build teams that see the problem from different and conflicting angles, and can make a beautiful, integrated answer from the parts. I try to experience new people and places through my work and find better answers to the challenges around me.</p>

"414","14871","2008-08-05 14:32:06","Stu","2021-05-04 18:04:45","http://None.","Sacramento, CA, United States","<p>Me? I turned my programming hobby into my profession in 1994, and I have gotten really, really good at it. The downside is that it has left me without any good hobbies.</p>

<p>I write excellent front ends. I like to pay all the taxes to make it good, localizable, testable, task-based, consistent, and other interesting adjectives – whereas your average Enterprisy web interface just makes me twitch.</p>

<p>But people have a way of finding out I am the only one at hand with experience in bleeding edge, obscure and weird things… so an hour later, I am suddenly working on background services, connection pool balancers, clustering, evaluating the newest Entity Framework, coding check-in policies, retrofitting mocking, porting ancient code from Fortran, diagnosing a SAN, and so on. My inner MacGyver approves.</p>

<p>Then those things taper off and I gravitate towards more Architecty things: evaluate new version of X, or find a library to do Y, or refactor huge project to fix 2 circular references (or maybe 800). more commonly, a lot of them). There is fun in going from “finds lots of issues in code reviews” to “writes the coding standards” to “full-codebase overhaul” to “defines life cycle” and “re-did the build from scratch” and “found a way to integrate 12,000 unit tests”. Note to self: demand raise next time.</p>

<p>Inevitably, we go from moving things to making things move faster. As much as I hate premature unfocused optimization, or  throwing hardware at a problem because it almost always actually works, some times are SHOWPLAN times. I have taken a Fortune-low-number data warehouse from “cannot do daily reports because the transform takes 40 hours, we are all going to get fired” to “refreshes every hour with time to spare”. Yes, that is fun.</p>

<p>I do not do “Big Data”. Half the people that use that term have no idea what it means, and the other half is lying their collective behinds off to puff their resume and cash in on the fad. So I’ve taken to call what I do “Lots of Data” instead. Usually it’s “Looots of Small Bits of Data”. Sooner or later I end up owning (run the systems) for 5-50TB. THAT is real.</p>

<p>I love agile and am deft at defending it from the many that do not like it. It structurally forces ownership and that truly motivates and improves. It makes people care. Without it you get, well… Oracle.</p>

<p>I breathe data warehouses, cubes, migrations, spatial data, partitioning, monte carlo, scale out, cloud and more. I’ve tackled – nay, spanked – the vagaries of health care, energy, and telecom.</p>

<p>The above is not a resume, just personal observations. I hope it amused you and spoke to you. If so, you should seriously consider giving me a lot of money to make your software and your life much better. And after that, you should give me a lot of money to me a lot of money to make your software and your life much better.</p>

I then spent three years using python and a smattering of ruby to create a cross-platform automated testing framework. After that I had two more gigs in windows shows, building automated testing frameworks and leading automation teams. I am now back to being a python developer at a small company in the independent publishing business. <p>

<hr>

<p>Tom spent a decade dealing with fallout from global state and failed semantic integrity of objects. Please don't make him cry.</p>

<p><strong>Why not try my <a href=""https://github.com/tackline/Little-Bean"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trivial ""IDE"" for single-file Java programs</a>?</strong></p>

<hr>

<h1>General Guidelines</h1>

<ul>
<li>Please obfuscate your code making it, at best, unobviously broken. Even if the code isn't important.</li>
<li>Global state has been a known bad idea for forty years. Please don't do it.</li>
<li>Corollary of either of the first two guidelines: Singletons are pure evil. Don't. </li>
<li>Please think about encapsulate. That implies not shoving getters and setters all over the place. Also prefer not use implementation inheritance and avoid protected. Generally limit unnecessary access and implied implementation, even on larger scales.</li>
<li>Please practice good dependency hygiene. Yeah it's not interesting, but turns out to be really important for a number of reasons.</li>
<li>If you're doing layers of security, please do check each layer individually. </li>
<li>Please don't give nulls a meaning. Throw an NPE.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Things that are wrong</h1>

<ul>
<li>""Postel's Law"". Good for UI, but for machine interface you wont catch errors and differences fixing mistakes allows TOCTOU-style vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. Increasing the number of reviewers decreases the depth each one expends on the problem. It's the maximum depth which is crucial unless the problem is trivial in which case who cares.</li>
<li>Vulnerabilities are the adversary's fault. Vulnerabilities are the fault of the party that decided to ship the faulty product.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Former work:</strong> Formerly a ""Vulnerability Engineer"" in the Java SE Security team for Oracle.</p>

<p><strong>Top advice:</strong> If I were you, I wouldn't be starting from here.</p>

<p><strong>Toast advice:</strong> Look after the corners and the middle will look after itself.</p>

I'm a Delphi and C# developer, going back to Turbo Pascal 5.5, TPW and BP/O7. Currently working with Xamarin, Winforms and some WPF. I do a reasonable amount of SQL Server (mostly schema design, sprocs and T-SQL utilities) and maintain some legacy apps that use Firebird, Interbase and MySQL.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I develop bespoke software - I run my <a href=""http://www.robsoft.net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">own small company</a>, mostly writing point-of-sale systems for the financial services and high-street finance type markets.<br>&nbsp;<br>
In my downtime I explore my Mac (I switched a few years ago, now I do all my work in VMs on the Mac), and I have a 4-year-old daughter who is the other 'apple of my eye'.<br>&nbsp;<br></p>

In my view, some of the essential skills for a good developer to have are a clear understanding of functional programming, test-driven development, Scrum or Kanban and continuous integration methods. A good manager of a team of developers therefore has to have those skills too.</p>

First computer I owned was a Sinclair ZX-81 on which I progressed to programming Z80 assembler by the time I was 13. I consider programming to be a lifetime learning experience.</p>

<p>In my early professional years there was Pascal and COBOL and in the 90's a fair amount of iSeries CLP and RPG.</p>

<p>My current professional experience includes extensive programming in C, Java and JavaScript. The former two languages were primarily in the networking and communications arena, while more recently doing JavaScript (with HTML5 and CSS) for web and mobile applications as well as creating services and the Java backend support (full stack). </p>

<p>My programming hobby activities are mostly in Java and JavaScript, but I enjoy dabbling with a variety of procedural, OOP and functional languages and the many hybrids thereof.</p>

<p>If I down-voted your answer, it was because it was either just wrong, or more often, because you failed to read the question. e.g., Q: ""I need a way to share files... I don't think I want Subversion..."" Your answer: ""Use subversion(link)"". Or you just posted the first link from Google, without any explanation.

Virtual and shared online environments is my current focus. User-interface design and human-facing applications has been my main specialty for well over 30 years contributing core IP to several startups.
</p>

<p>
I have specific experience in 2D, 3D, VR and AR applications over a wide array of projects for several young startups dating back to days at MIT's Media Lab.
In the past, I've been involved with unique work utilizing Papervision, Alternativa, Torque and Unity. Most recently I've made many exploratory 3d environments with WebGL, and shared environment experiments built utilizing nodejs, a-frame, and reactjs also.
</p>

<p>
Today I am creating <b>Infinite Stores</b> - a spatial CMS platform and editing tools for making dynamic content-rich 3D and virtual reality shopping experiences.</p> 

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OCbs2.jpg"">
<p><b>Infinite Stores</b> provides individuals as well as groups of artisans a new way to sell products online via virtual store-spaces within an endless shopping universe that they can maintain and visually merchandise - just like real-world stores. The layout and mgmt apps are super easy to use and run in any web browser and do not require any special equipment. Engaging store experiences can be enjoyed by anyone who loves to shop -  via client apps that run on the web, on mobile, and immersively via head-mounted VR systems.</p>

I am a software developer by trade but like many programmers it is also a hobby.  My first program was written on a Commodore 64.  In college I wrote C++, Fortran and a touch of Pascal.  
</p>

<p>
I started my professional career doing web development before the bubble (the one around 2001) using ASP, PERL, Java and SQL.  Over the years I have spent a lot of time programming for the web and the desktop.
</p>

<p>
The current app I am building is an Angular2 app using ngrx, based on a stack that includes WebApi, SQL Server Datawarehouse, and nifty languages like C#, TypeScript, SQL, and LESS.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy snowboarding, travel and baseball.  The latter two hobbies are shared with my wife.  My wife and I have seen games at numerous spring training, major league, and minor league ball parks.

<h1>Answers</h1>

<p>When you answer a question, don't just paste your code. Your answers will be much better when you explain why your code is doing what it does and how it achieves the asker's goal. It makes it a whole lot easier to follow along. As it is I am much more inclined to up-vote answers that have an explanatory text about what the code is doing and why it is written as it is.</p>

<p>I'm a freelance software developer. I'm probably available to work on your project, if you need someone and don't mind me working from Japan. I'm a US citizen, if it matters, and can bill via my US-based company or from Japan. I'm open to full-time engagements if you have a team of pleasant people to work with (or want me to make one for you).</p>

<p>I like doing Ruby on Rails, and Asp.Net MVC projects, although I'd be happy for an excuse to build something in Elixir with Phoenix or Scala, and I'm capable of working in Java. Most of the work I enjoy most is domain-layer and service-layer work. I'm spending a fair amount of time working with Docker recently, as well.</p>

<p>I can make a front end look nice while working with a visual designer, but am not a front-end specialist. I do know enough of Vue.js and old school jQuery to be useful, and I can probably be persuaded to work in React.</p>

<p>In previous lives, I've worked for Microsoft, Revenue Science (now Audience Science), Zillow, a travel company called Virtuoso, the Seattle Times, and a very strange financial/transportation conglomerate, and I've done software consulting in the pharmaceutical industry, apparel, e-commerce, and so on. I've also worked as a solutions engineer or solutions architect.</p>

<p>If you're interested in tracking down a reasonably competent Rails or ASP.net MVC developer and are located near Tokyo, Japan or don't mind me working mostly remotely, feel free to contact me. I'm open to regular travel outside of Japan if it makes things easier for the team.</p>

<p>I like to cook. I'm pretty good at it. Sometimes I post pictures of what I'm cooking and/or eating on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jasontrue/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Instagram</a>.</p>

I specialize in low-level coding, client/server applications, and even UI programs.  I recently got into iOS programming and find it very fun and challenging, while opening up a completely new world of possibilities!</p>

<p>I am into high power rocketry, and digital video/audio.  I reversed the Dolby Surround algorithm back in 1990/1991, and was constructing audio files on my Amiga that would address each of the surround speakers for demo's and such.  I have appeared on many TV shows and news clips involving High Power Rocketry (<a href=""http://www.tripoli.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tripoli.org</a>).</p>

<p>I've been programming since about 1983, when I got my first Timex Sinclar 1000 w/ 2k of RAM and a 16k RAM expansion pack.  I started writing my own game programs in 1985 and 1986, then moved on to writing serial based software in BBS programs and terminal software.<br>
I worked at Mustang Software for 6 years doing support, QA, Configuration Management, and even programming on Wildcat, QModem Pro, OLX, and later IMC, ListCaster and FileCenter, before the company was purchased by Quintus Corp. and later Avya, who shut down our offices.</p>

<p>I was in four or five episodes of The BBS Documentary (<a href=""http://www.bbsdocumentary.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbsdocumentary.com</a>), for my contributions to the BBS world, having worked and done so much at Mustang Software, including running my own 16 line BBS that still survives to this day via Telnet to <a href=""http://telnet://bbs.mlinks.com"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Missing Links Network"">telnet://bbs.mlinks.com</a></p>

<p>I have background in such subjects as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cryptography</li>
<li>Virus Research/Anti-Virus</li>
<li>Data Compression</li>
<li>Client/Server</li>
<li>Assembly Language</li>
<li>Database (SQL/Oracle/Access) Administration</li>
<li>API Development</li>
</ul>

<p>Just to name a few...</p>

<p>I am always looking to learn something, and am never happy just using someone else' code to perform tasks that I could learn how to do myself.</p>

<p>Some of the apps I have written:</p>

<ul>
<li>NNTP Server</li>
<li>Security DVR PTZ Camera Controller/Viewer</li>
<li>HTML Based Focus Group Chat</li>
<li>Wireless POS System</li>

</p>

<p>I hold a Master's Degree in Computer Science and a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science, both from the University of Delaware.</p>

<p><b>Work</b></p>

<p><p>Worked at Bell Labs from 1986 to 1991 in an applied Artificial Intelligence group building custom probabilistic logics to perform categorization and classification of ambiguous signals. After a brief stop doing C++ UI work in another department, I moved to Bell Labs' Advanced User Interface design group where I stayed until 1995.<br>
</p><p>
I started my own software company, BSDI, in 1991 and pursued it part time until leaving Bell Labs.  BSDI is now one of the most influential software companies in the Fitness and Health Promotion market (If you haven't heard of us, it is because we work only with F/HP professionals - not with end users). </p></p>

That forces you to sort it out in your mind. And the more slow and dim-witted your pupil, the more you have to break things down into more and more simple ideas. And that's really the essence of programming.

By the time you've sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, you've learned something about it yourself."" - Douglas Adams</p>

<p>My responsibilities require skills in C#, Javascript, and a little VB every now and then (yuk!). I have worked with classic ASP and ASP.NET (Webforms and MVC), Windows Forms and Web Services (REST and SOAP) and previously, quite a bit of SQL server programming.</p>

<p>We have a small shop, so I work the full stack. However, my best work seems to be in web apps (server and client). I prefer ASP.NET MVC as the serverside technology and on the client side I use Knockout, jQuery, etc. and looking forward to start working with Typescript and Angular. We now have several apps hosted in Windows Azure, so I've become quite familiar with working in that environment. Although web apps are the mainstay, I've started mobile cross-platform dev with Xamarin.</p>

Fast &amp; accurate.  Uses real-world statistics aggregated from wikipedia, and can therefore deal well even with cases that might trip up rules-based systems (e.g. an NSA analyst vs. a NASA flight plan).

<p>I've been a developer for over 30 years at all levels from junior developer to team lead and project manager. I learnt Pascal at University and my first job was programming in FORTRAN 66. I've since moved to Silverlight with C# & .NET via Ada, C and C++ and a bit of ASP.NET. I've worked at companies varying in size from a five person startup to a multinational games company.</p>

<p>Over the years I've used most operating systems (apart from MacOS/iOS!), starting with PR1MOS and then moving onto various flavours of Unix. I'm now exclusively on Windows, but really should get back into other areas. The only things that are holding me back are lack of time and resources!</p>

<p>I'm Tim, and I used to work here as the Community Evangelist for Stack Overflow. You'll notice that I've written quite a few things on many of our meta sites, and I hope you find some value in it!</p>
<p>I'm still around Stack Overflow as an advisor (maybe they'll call me the evangelist emeritus, that would be cool!). My day-to-day effort here goes mostly into moderation and helping to guide the community, as I've done <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/election/1"">since 2011</a>.</p>

Physicist by training, now a programmer by choice.  My languages of preference are Java and C, although I am also skilled in C# and many assembly languages, and competent in Perl, general shell scripting, and a handful of other languages I use less often.  I can speak basic SQL.  I write my HTML by hand and prefer table-free page layout.
</p>

<p>
NOTE:  I <em>never</em> do retaliatory downvotes or anything petty like that.  I am here to learn as well as to teach.  If something I write is worthy of a downvote, please leave a comment to let me know why. If I am incorrect, I want to know!
</p>

<p>
I use Linux by preference, but also develop extensively under Windows.  I've developed under various embedded and custom OS's and RTOS's (primarily <a href=""http://www.radisys.com/Products/Microware/OS-9-RTOS.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Microware OS-9</a> and VxWorks), assorted UNIXes, VAX/VMS, and assorted Windows releases.  I've played with RSTS/E and a few other operating systems that are unknown today.

<p>I am obsessive about all things java and enterprise software and integration patterns in general. I also dabble in a few JVM based languages such as groovy, scala, JACL and Jelly. </p>

<p>I have a lot of fun with browser oriented user interface toolkits like GWT,  EXT-JS, YUI, JQuery. More recently I've been building some fun vizualizations for large data sets using D3 and scalable vector graphics.</p>

<p>Server side, I have a long history (love,hate) with traditional relational databases such as SQL Server and Oracle, but lately have been favoring of more nimble relational databases such as Postgres at scale, and H2. For larger data sets, MongoDB, Redis, Casandra and Hadoop have all proved to be great noSQL solutions and great fun to build and deploy apps in modern cloud environments like Amazon AWS.</p>

<h2><b> I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people</b></h2>

<p>-- Sir Isaac Newton
<br></p>

<h2><b> Time heals all wounds, but  ultimately kills the organism....</b></h2>

<p>-- paraphrased Hector Berlioz quote</p>

<h2>""Lloyd-Webber's awful stuff<br>
Runs for years and years and years<br>
An earthquake hits the theatre<br>
But the operetta lingers<br>
Then the piano lid comes down<br>
And breaks his fucking fingers<br>
It's a miracle"" - Roger Waters</h2>

<p><br></p>

<h2>What God Wants God Gets</h2>

<p><br> Succinctness is Godliness<br>
<p> oh and just in case anyone is wondering:<br/><br/>
<b>ennui</b> - interminable boredom<br/>
<b>killer</b> - a person or thing that kills<br/><br/>
<b>ennuikiller</b> - a person who kills interminable boredom</p>

<p><p><strong>About the avatar</strong>:
<p>It is in memory of 2 of the greatest geniuses of the 20th century (or perhaps in any century).  </p>

<p><p>1. Peter Sellers whose comic genius inspired a whole slew of successful comedians and what better accomplishment to leave to the world than laughter!!</p>

<p><p> 2.Stanley Kubrick whose films have been both iconoclastic and <b>profoundly humanistic</b> (I think some may have missed this point).  I believe his crowning achievement is in fact <b>Dr. Strangelove</b> who is pictured in the avatar.  A dark comedy (but with very serious overtones) about the ease with which the human species can eradicate itself.  If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it RIGHT NOW!</p>

<p>The first programming language I learned was Pascal; later, I found my way to FoxPro and a bit of ANSI C. From there on, I moved to dynamically-typed and scriptings languages like PHP3 and later versions, Perl, Python 2.7 and 3, and JavaScript. Oh yes, let us not forget ActionScript.</p>
<p>I also feel comfortable with SQL as it has been part of my learning career since PHP3, and its English-like-syntax makes it easy to remember.</p>
<p><strong>Books:</strong> Thinking, Fast and Slow, The No Asshole Rule, Let My People Go Surfing, Clean Code, and I'd recommend reading &quot;High-Performance MySQL.&quot;   to anyone interested in learning about databases' nuts and bolts.</p>
<p><strong>Random:</strong> I am a VI, Linux, and Bash fan. Almost 20 years later and I still have room to improve. And Python has become my go-to scripting language.</p>
<p><strong>Deficiencies:</strong> I have never cared much for .NET solutions and probably should have been more open-minded about it. There is time to learn - time will tell.</p>

<p>
If you develop a program for a long period of time by only adding features but never reorganizing it to reflect your understanding of those features, then eventually that program simply does not contain any understanding and all efforts to work on it take longer and longer.
</p>
<p>There is no right answer ... and always a better way. Show and discuss your code, without emotional attachment. You are not your code.</p>
<p>Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the goal, and just keep taking the next step towards completing it.</p>
<p>The game isn't really about big edges and firework displays; it's about subtle advantages and what happens in the long run.</p>
<p>It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets credit.</p>
<p>Maybe the best programmers aren’t those who spectacularly solve crazy problems, but those who don’t create them, which is much more silent.</p>

<p>Currently I code for fun, and occasional profit, and I'm fascinated by making information work. However, while I'm <em>happy</em> to code 'for fun,' I'd be absolutely thrilled to hear of any front-end web-dev (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) vacancies or job-openings...</p>

<p>I'm always interested to hear of new projects, if anyone wants any help or additional input. Feel free to contact me via this site if there's anything I can help with.</p>

<p>If I've been able to help you, and you're feeling gracious and/or <em>altruistic</em> as a result, please consider buying something off one of these <a href=""http://www.childsplaycharity.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Child's Play</a> Wishlists, on my behalf:</p>

</ul>

<p>Obviously, there are other hospitals around the world that are equally in need of toys and games for children, so if you don't fancy donating to a British hospital, for whatever reason, please consider taking another look at the Child's Play website, and see if there's a hospital nearer to you that maybe deserves something.</p>

His earliest memory of debugging a program was when he found that his mother had typed the letter O instead of the digit 0 in a hexadecimal string that defined the graphics of a program she copied from the listing in a magazine.</p>

<p>After discovering Delphi 1.0 during college, he went to work on a fax broadcast system and other telephony projects.</p>

<p>In the late 90's he worked with a few record labels to put software on their music CD's.  This included Windows screen savers of album art work and a music player that scrolled the lyrics of each song across the screen -- all written in Delphi.</p>

<p>After that, he spent about 5 years doing web development in PHP (even working with a PHP MVC Framework) before discovering ASP.NET and C#.</p>

<p>He remained somewhat proud of the fact that he had never worked with Visual Basic until starting a job in 2007 where it was the company's language of choice for developing Microsoft Office customizations for the legal industry.  Even though he got lost any time he tried to look at VB6 code, with the advent of LINQ to XML and XML Literals in VB9, he was happy to be a VB.NET developer.</p>

<p>In 2012, upon returning to full-time web development, he was pleased to discover that working with JavaScript sure isn't what it used to be.</p>

<p>He has been running Elm in production since June 2018 -- no runtime errors, for the win!</p>

<p>From 2014 to 2019 he organized the Dallas Functional Programmers user group (dallasfp.com) and enjoyed exploring various FP languages with people who share his passion.</p>

I've been programming every day for around 38 years, and have dabbled in a huge variety of languages and platforms, the best being ARM assembler in the early '90s. Glorious! Since then I've focussed on C, C++, and now C#. But now my phone has an ARM in it... hmmm... :-)
</p>

<p>
I do all this on my sluggish 3GHz quad-core, pining for the good old days when I had a blazingly fast 8MHz CPU and didn't have to wait all day for my word processor to display the next character :-)</p>

<p>Among many other things I have worked on the worlds fastest vector art package, many games including Douglas Adams' Starship Titanic and Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy, and a subsea flight simulator. Currently I work on aerodynamics analysis software for Formula 1 and the <a href=""http://www.atomineerutils.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Atomineer Pro Documentation</a> Xml/Doxygen/Qt/JavaDoc extension for Visual Studio.

Software generalist, cut my teeth on C/C++, have done more Java, both in general and via Blue Martini's APIs, than I care to admit, as well as liberal doses of PHP, Perl, shell scripting, SQL, and miscellaneous.  These days I mostly do Ruby on Rails, the platform I wish I had when I was a starry-eyed 20 year old with more business ideas than sense.  I like tools but try to keep task prioritized over technology, so I try not to have a general bias in favor of or against a particular platform or language.

  <p>The act of Programming is indeed thinking. The pure act of Typing is just materializing of what has been thought. Of course, there is a bidirectional feedback connection between writing and thinking. At least for introverts; dunno about extroverts :) And given that, I disagree with @MisterPositive: Of course the typing part needs to be paid, too - a master stone sculptor gets not only paid for planning the sculpture, but also for liberating the sculpture from the stone.</p>

  <p>Many of these fancy web-design fads of the last years may be neat to look at the first few times, be it caroussels, infinite scroll, lazy loading or even (shriek) horizontal layouts, but then they suck from a user's point of view. E.g., with lazy loading one gets different results for incremental search, depending on how much has been scrolled over; crazyness. Also, many of those magick apparatuses destroy conversion rates, something that seems to not exist for a perceived 95%+ majority of webdesigners.

  <p>Also: I really recommend to strike ""why don't they use X, yet"", ""why do they still use X"" and all variants thereof (regex: <code>(still|allready)?.*(use|using).*(yet)?</code>) from your list of idioms. I always get frightened when hearing that, because it's often enough a red flag indicating blind faith in something. ""Yo brother, work for us, we're already using .net, you know"" was something I heard quite often 10 years ago. It sounded like they seriously believed that .net was the One True Thing to use. Know what I mean? My newest favourite acronym fits nicely: <strong><code>A.S.S., Always Stay Skeptical</code></strong>.</p>

The technical answers require more effort to put together, but they seem to get few or no upvotes.  I think people don't upvote answers to technical questions as much because effort is required to verify their correctness, as opposed to simply agreeing with someone's subjective opinion.<br><br>

The more difficult the technical question was to answer, the less people there will be with the technical capability to evaluate your answer for correctness.

That way you don't get tied up fixing bugs and you can go on and write some more software that does something else.  Production code should be robust enough to just chug along doing its thing, right?</p>

<p>An oligarchy of five justices setting policy for the entire USA is not the government the Constitution guarantees, and it's not the one we want.  Not everything President Gerald Ford said was very smart or worth repeating, but this is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The USA was designed as a Constitutional Republic, with checks-and-balances between the branches of the federal government, and also division of power between federal state and local governments.  (And these are explicitly required by the plain language of the Constitution)  All government officials need to stay within the authority granted to them by the Constitution, especially when that means they can't do whatever they want.</p>

<ul>
<li>A multiuser/multitasking DOS-compatible OS... which ran on PC-XTs!<br></li>
<li>A distributed inventory/orders system for a computer store chain. Online updates of MDB database content AND structure. In 1997.<br></li>
<li>Access control system for an ISP. Kinda Rube Goldberg-ish. Lots of scripts that manipulate iptables to turn users to the login page, dhcpd to give thep IPs, cbq to assign them bandwidth etc.<br></li>
<li>A security system for MS-DOS, implementing somewhat-Unix-style accounts and permissions.<br></li>
<li>Clustering Asterisk PBXs for call centers.<br></li>
<li>Autodialers with detection of human / answering machine / busy / bad number for (I'm going to Hell for this) active telemarketing. Please forgive me.<br></li>
<li>A driver to integrate Skype into Asterisk. Even more Rube Goldberg-ish than the ISP login thing.<br></li>
<li>Energy consumption billing through a proprietary board that ""ticked"" a bit in a parallel interface whenever X watts-hours had gone through path Y.<br></li>
<li>Linux system-restore CDs.<br></li>
<li>Satellite image acquiring through yet another proprietary expansion board, for Brazil's National Space Research Institute.<br></li>
<li>REST services with Django.<br></li>
<li>Remote system audits in C# using the OVAL language.<br></li>
<li>For the retrocomputing fans out there: <a href=""https://sourceforge.net/projects/cachars"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sourceforge.net/projects/cachars</a><br></li>
<li>Lots more I sure forget about now.<br><br></li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and I just learned CUDA and Greenplum. They're neat. But I didn't get to use either in any project so far. :-/<br><br></p>

<p>Things I like for fun:<br>
- Formula One and Indy racing. (You get brownie points if you guess what race my avatar is from.)<br>
- Reading in general, mostly nonfiction.<br>
- Retrocomputing and retrogaming.<br>
- Traveling, preferably overseas.<br>
- Sci-fi in general, and Star Trek in particular.</p>

<p>===============================</p>

<p>Oct 2012: The ""moderator community"" at Meta has convinced me that answers I provide that mention my company's software tools are unwanted (at least by many of them) on Stack Overflow, in spite of the fact that my upvote score per answer averages the same as Jon Skeet's; note moderator deletions of many of my tool answers.  Since these tools are what I live and breathe, most of what I have say that is constructive is thus unwanted.  So, I expect to respond to further questions at likely a lower rate.  </p>

<p>Related to this is the problem of SO moderators closing tool questions in general (what? programming is about using tools!), because ""answers are likely to be opinionated"". So what? People either like their tools or they don't. And opinions from old hands and smart people are often pretty useful in making a good choice.</p>

<p><em>If you think, as I do, that Stack Overflow is about providing good answers (in list form or not) regardless of who provides them, you can take up that case in Meta.</em></p>

<p>==================================</p>

<p>I'm a principal at Semantic Designs.  Many of my answers point to tools or products of SD, many of which I have a direct role in engineering; its what I know intimately.  When I provide such answers, I try to make sure that the answer is relevant to the specific question being asked. YMMV.
<br></p>

<p>Some of tools I have built at SD:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/DMS/DMSToolkit.html?StackOverflow=UserPage"" rel=""nofollow"">DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit</a>, a commercial program transformation engine [architect and implementer]. Check out this invited <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-_dw9iEzhA"" rel=""nofollow"">Google Tech talk video on DMS</a>.</li>
<li>DMS <a href=""http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/FrontEnds"" rel=""nofollow"">front ends for Ada, VB6, C#, Java, ObjectiveC, PLSQL, FORTRAN, PHP, Python, Natural.</a> [implementer] (DMS also handles full C++14.)</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/Clone?StackOverflow=UserPage"" rel=""nofollow"">CloneDR</a>, a leading clone detection tool [architect/implementer]</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/Parlanse/index.html?StackOverflow=UserPage"" rel=""nofollow"">PARLANSE (parallel programming language for SMP x86)</a>.
Used to implement DMS and CloneDR. [Design of language and implementation of compiler for x86]
<br></li>
</ul>

<p>A lesson people keep relearning when building program analysis tools is that parsing is nowhere near enough. See my discussion on why I built DMS, to enable <a href=""http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/DMS/LifeAfterParsing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Life After Parsing</a>.

Working with <em>#Open Source</em> technologies and contributing back.  Over the years I filled roles in <em>#systems</em>, <em>#backend</em> and <em>#devops</em> in #storage and <em>#security</em> companies.  Worked with <em>#AWS</em>, <em>#Bash</em>, <em>#Docker</em>, #ELK, <em>#Flask</em>, <em>#Git</em>, <em>#PKI</em>, <em>#SQL</em> and much more.</p>
<p>I am an <em>#autodidact</em>. Constantly learning new techniques and technologies (such as <em>#async/await</em>, <em>#FastAPI</em>, <em>#Haskell</em>, etc).  I also tend to disseminate knowledge: Diligent documentation writer, an experienced and well received instructor, both #mentoring one-on-one and as a public speaker.  This is one of the reasons I consider myself one of the lucky few for whom their job is also their hobby and passion.  Happiest when coding using Emacs.</p>
<p>Successfully completed projects I wrote from scratch as well as took ownership and maintained legacy code.  Consumed and designed <em>#API</em>s (<em>#REST</em>ful and otherwise).
I also worked with Networking (<em>#TCP/IP</em>) I am not a stranger to reading RFCs. Done development support work with dynamic languages (<em>#Python</em>, <em>#Perl</em>) and shell scripting (#Bash), created build and deployment systems (<em>#CMake</em>, GNU build tools), designed #CI/CD pipelines (<em>#GitLab-CI</em>, <em>#Jenkins</em>).</p>
<p>A long time ago in a galaxy far away I also done some low level development with C/C++ and code migration, writing in both the Linux kernel and user space.  Now a days prefer Rust for low level tasks.</p>

<p>Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.</p>

<p>Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.</p>

<p>Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about."" &mdash; <a href=""http://threevirtues.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Three Virtues</a></p>

<p>In 2017, I left Silicon Valley to focus on personal and spiritual interests, and today I am a full-time religious minister of Jehovah's Witnesses.</p>

<p>Besides being fluent in English and American Sign Language, I know too many programming languages to count. Some of my favorites include Java, Python, and C#, although I'm also known to nerd out about functional languages and complex type systems.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I play guitar and read voraciously.</p>

<p> #SOreadytohelp </p>

<p>I studied history at university but didn't want to stay in academia. After my finals I read ""Neuromancer"" by William Gibson and decided to try computing. Those were the days when a history graduate with no relevant experience could get a job in IT. Luckily, I had an aptitude. At school, one teacher had repeatedly told my class that history was a training in the gathering, analysis and presentation of data; we scoffed but he was right. Also I enjoyed programming COBOL. It was like being paid to solve crossword puzzles all day.</p>

<p>Since 1992 I have worked on Oracle database systems, both OLTP and DWH. Over that time I have worked as a data modeller, designer, developer and DBA. I have also undertaken assignments as a business analyst and a technical architect. If pushed, I would have to say I'm happiest writing PL/SQL programs. I am least happy when attempting to marry a normalised data model to the needs of an ORM tool.</p>

<p>I was made an Oracle ACE in 2003, and transitioned to Ace Alumni status in 2019.  In 2003 I won the Oracle Magazine OTN Contributor of the Year award.</p>

<p>The key skill set I've used to accomplish this is my natural ability to quickly understand complex systems and simplify them in disruptive ways, a burning need to do good in the world, and an instinctive tenacity for always finding a way even in the most difficult of situations.</p>

<p>I have always used very specialised automatic test equipment, which gives me an unusual perspective on how to solve software problems (usually <em>by myself</em> without recourse to libraries and frameworks). This is definitely <strong>not</strong> mainstream, but I don't create <em>commercial</em> software: my user-base is my fellow employees.</p>

<p>My contributions to SO probably seem <em>other-worldly</em>, but the programming environments I've used have never been Windows-based and only vaguely Unix-like.</p>

<p><strong>HOWEVER</strong> &#8212; In late February 2010, I was admitted to hospital with a suspected stroke. Tests showed it wasn't a stroke, it is <em>Multiple Sclerosis</em>. Thus begins an inevitable slide into disability.</p>

<p>While I'm now back at work, hopefully for a few more years, I think the effort of engaging in SO (after a lull of over 12 months) might be too much for me. Besides, I can't type as fast as I used to.</p>

<p>My neurologist made the disturbing comment that I may have lost some mental faculties and be unaware of it, so my presence on SE websites will serve to test whether my brain still works.</p>

I started with Apple Basic, then Timex Sinclair (ZX-81 at the time) Basic.  After that I discovered the list of op-codes next to the ASCII chart in my ZX-81 manual.  I began to compile my own hand-lettered sheets that put all the addressing modes of a given instruction in the same place so I could more easily handle-assemble small machine language programs.</p>

<p>It's gone on from there.  The learning never ends.</p>

<p>Currently I do most of my programming in Python and C++ on Linux.  I have a strong preference for Open Source software.</p>

<p>My best and favorite language is Python. I first learned to code in Perl, which really wasn't the greatest of introductions.  (Bad programming practices!) I always found programming tedious and boring, yet still necessary, before I discovered Python.</p>

<p>I have lots of skills with all things tech:  servers, network hardware, firewalls, game systems... It's all prime for hacking!!</p>

<br/><br/>
I graduated in 2009 from Stevens Institute of Technology with a bachelors and masters of science in Computer Science, a minor in Law &amp; Public Policy, and graduate certificates in Computer Systems, Databases &amp; Service Oriented Architecture, Distributed Systems, Enterprise Computing, Quantitative Software Engineering, and Service Oriented Computing.
<br/><br/>
I got my start programming at a very young age, writing QBasic programs to display colorful circles on the screen while sitting on my dad's lap when I was 3 years old. My first big projects were a Super Mario World clone for GameBoy, a MUD called HybridMOO, and a home automation package called IntellHome (which I still use!).
<br/><br/>
I'm actively involved in a number of open source initiatives, including an open-source middleware tool called PushoverQ.
<br/><br/>
I am interested in hiking, exploration of abandoned or neglected sites and buildings, photography (particularly of those abandoned sites, but also glamour/editorial), cooking, snowshoeing, and New Jersey trivia/history.</p>

I use my own build of Python that is portable (to Linux OSes) and entirely self-contained.</p>

<p>Lately I've been coding an application and some tools that make use of AMQP messaging, in particular using RabbitMQ as the MQ Broker. I am very impressed at how AMQP, combined with network db APIs, lets you build an application in many small decoupled components that can easily be scaled on one or many servers.</p>

<p>Since RabbitMQ is implemented in Erlang, I learned enough Erlang to make a simple management app that runs on an independent Erlang node, i.e. not a RabbitMQ plugin. And since my company's main language is Java, I am now learning Scala (with Akka actors) since this JVM language has part of its heritage in Erlang.</p>

I started programming when I was 10 after seeing SHRDLU on television... watching a robotic arm understand and correctly react to the command “Pick up a big red block” is a moment forever burned in my memory. Not long after that I played Intellivision at my cousin Matt’s house which occupied countless hours of my youth. I was never satisfied with simply playing the games, I wanted to know what was going on behind the scenes. At the same time my parents gave me my first computer: a TI99/4A, and my passion for creating software took root. The first program I wrote was not ""Hello World"", it was a chatter bot. I coded many games on that machine, including a Wizardry clone, which I would trade (via audio cassettes) with my like minded schoolmates.</p>

<p>Since then I've worked for a Fortune 500 company (AutoZone), an iconic American company (Yankee Candle), an indie game company making games for the blind (All inPlay), and I even took a stab at my company creating artificial intelligence tools and educational software. </p>

<p>I've been coding for almost 30 years - most of it professionally - and I love that I ""work"" in a profession where every day I learn something new and have the potential to change lives, heck, there are a couple marriages and even kids that resulted from some of my work at All inPlay.</p>

After an attempt to create his own start-up, he chooses a geographical relocation closer to his origins, near Geneva in the Alps.</p>
<p>From this point in time, he has been working in Switzerland. He first wrote computer programs for a cable and satellite pay TV provider, controlling the data streams that were traveling back and forth from the Earth to televisions.</p>
<p>He then joined a small company named Acqiris, writing Linux device drivers for High-Speed Digitizer PCI cards. Acqiris was bought out in late 2006 by Agilent Technologies, where he has continued spreading Linux support to other instruments. The Electronics Measurement Group of Agilent Technologies then became Keysight Technologies.</p>
<p>In August 2017, the PCIe High-Speed Digitizer business spun off from Keysight, giving birth for the second time to Acqiris.</p>

The company has been sold and I now live on a sailboat with my beautiful wife and twins.</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<p>I went to University of Wyoming and after a long time I got a Masters in Computer Science.   More importantly I found and married my beautiful wife, Sasha.</p>

<p>I spent 2 years working on contract to IBM in Kingston NY.  That gave me some exposure to doing contract work for a large company.  After that I took 2 years off and made pottery.</p>

<p>The peculiar charms of being a starving artist were not in my plans, so I got a contract job for US West in Denver, Colorado.
Two years later I had had enough of that.  So I quit and started my own contracting company.  I worked for 30+ different companies in the next 10 years around the metro Denver area.
These included AMAX Mining, Newmont Mining and Information Handling Services.   I made good money and survived a bout of pneumonia.  We bought a house and had fun remodeling it.
A little sailboat, an 18 foot Capri, came into our lives and for one summer we lived on it.</p>

<p>On a dark moonless night in the parking lot of a pizza place I committed to building a product based software company.  I worked with a friend that had already set up the corporate structure - so he had already picked the name Senware.  To him it stood for SENsible softWARE.  To me it was just a name.   At the same time as building the company my wife and I had twins.  (Yes I built a software company and had newborn twins at the same time.  Don't ever tell me about tired or lack of sleep.  Been there Done that.)  We built an Oracle database management product and eventually sold the company.</p>

<p>After working for 3 years as an employee of the new owners, I quit and moved on board a 50 foot sailboat.  We are now on the east cost of the US and the Bahamas.</p>

<p>I am building a new start-up now.  I am <b>so</b> excited.</p>

<ul>
<li>If I downvote your stuff, <b>I will leave a comment telling you why</b>.</li>
<li>If I see an answer that's syntactically incorrect, <b>I will downvote it</b>.</li>
<li>If I see an answer that doesn't answer the question, <b>I will downvote it</b>.</li>
<li>If you fix your stuff, <b>I will remove my downvote & the comment</b>.</li>
<li>If I realize I was wrong, <b>I will remove my downvote and leave a comment acknowledging the downvote was undeserved</b>.</li>

I encourage you to apply my rules on my stuff. That's how people get better.

<p>In my opinion, the whole stack exchange network has started to rot.</p>

<p>Moderators seem to be incapable of differentiating between abusive behaviour and defensive behaviour. As a result, they have been allowing abusers to run rampant carrying out their attacks unchallenged. I personally have observed and experienced numerous instances where moderators actively participate in abuse against users merely trying to protect themselves from the abusers.</p>

<p>This combined with the company's promulgated efforts to retain users seems to have resulted in a misguided desire ""protect"" new users at all costs.</p>

<ul>
<li>When new users come to the expecting and even <em>demanding</em> ""service"", they're not to be taken to task.</li>
<li>Instead of teaching new users when they do wrong, the effort is to molly-coddle them regardless of negativity they bring.</li>
<li>As a result the network is likely to breed a caucus of <em>retained users</em> who have never learnt to improve their own behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sadly I have serious concerns that a once-great network of sites is headed to self-destruction.</p>

I have and have had other titles, <a href=""https://vendiadvertising.com/who/chris-haas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Director of Development</a>, Lead Developer, etc., but I think coder is what really describes me these days.</p>
<p>I love to hate PHP, and I have to say &quot;needle&quot; and &quot;haystack&quot; several times a day outload to make sure I'm doing things correctly. (I get that right 90% of the time these days, too.) Coming from .Net, I miss generics but only for collections.</p>
<p>JavaScript is probably my favorite language. Not jQuery, Node, React or whatever framework is cool this week, but JavaScript. No compiling, interpreting or transpiling, just raw JS (with the evolutions provided by ES).</p>
<p>After spending over a decade with .Net (C# and VB.Net) using Visual Studio, I then spent way too long without an IDE and cannot stress enough: USE AN IDE!!! Even if you have to <a href=""https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pay for it</a>. Notepad, Sublime, VIM, grep, sed, etc., are all well and fine for simple things, but seriously, switching to an IDE can save so much time.</p>
<p>I also like talking and writing about technical things, and given the stage, I can go <a href=""https://vendiadvertising.com/insight/website-metrics-everything-you-need-know-about-bounce-rate-google-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on</a> and <a href=""https://vendiadvertising.com/insight/4-steps-building-website"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on</a> and <a href=""https://vendiadvertising.com/insight/content-management-system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, for no good reason except that they make me smile, here's some quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.
— <a href=""https://twitter.com/fortes/status/399339918213652480"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Filipe Fortes, 2013-11-10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A comment in a CSS file means you've probably sinned in your code. — Chris Haas, 2020-03-31 (private Slack)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone ever dread writing a block of code, only to find out that you already wrote it a month ago? Really makes you smile.  — Chris Haas, 2020-04-22 (private Slack)</p>

<p>PHing Is Not GNU make; it's a PHP project build system or build tool based on  Apache Ant. You can do anything with it that you could do with a traditional build system like GNU make, and its use of simple XML build files and extensible PHP ""task"" classes make it an easy-to-use and highly flexible build framework. Features include running PHPUnit and SimpleTest unit tests (including test result and coverage reports), file transformations (e.g. token replacement, XSLT transformation, Smarty template transformations), file system operations, interactive build support, SQL execution, CVS/SVN operations, tools for creating PEAR packages, and much more.</p>

<p>If you find yourself writing custom scripts to handle the packaging, deploying, or testing of your applications, then we suggest looking at the Phing framework. Phing comes packaged with numerous out-of-the-box operation modules (tasks), and an easy-to-use OO model for adding your own custom tasks. </p>

<p>I have helped lead my team to significantly improve productivity and return on investment across many client projects; leveraging Kubernetes, Docker, Golang, Cassandra, Kafka and Elastic to name a few. My team and I are developing more productive, stable, clean and faster applications than we ever have in the past, and the results are beautiful and innovative IOT management systems, IOT implementations, mobile applications, business intelligence and data management platforms. </p>

<p>As the former Director of R&amp;D at Napster and later a hand full of Universal and Sony subsidiaries, I have been fortunate to spend many of my early days on the bleeding edge, in the open green fields of new media and disruptive technology. </p>

<p>I architected NBC.com's first unified web platform and “NBC Live,” a real-time, second-screen, synchronized television experience for NBC viewers.

Have been a professional developer since 1995 (with some breaks), using mainly Java and C++. A fan of agile methods and refactoring, addicted to unit tests, in love with functional programming and Scala. In 2014 became Certified ScrumMaster. In 2017 acquired GIAC Secure Java Web Developer certification.</p>

<p>On 26 November 2017, on the way to work, I got hit by a car and as a result, got severe brain damage. Spent close to half a year in the hospital (thanks to the doctors and the crew of Turku University Hospital!). It seems that I lost my creativity and programming skills in the accident, so I can't work as a full-time programmer anymore.</p>

You can help me contribute to the community by <a href=""https://github.com/users/joshuaulrich/sponsorship"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sponsoring me on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I love working on the hardest problems. My home is *nix and the command line. I enjoy the challenge of doing root-cause analysis on complex, distributed systems. I use an evidence-based approach to troubleshooting: I evaluate how available information might suggest behavior, then validate or disprove. I believe software engineering is all about communication.</p>

<p>I love uncovering relationships in data. More importantly, I work to understand the data generating process that creates the relationships, and I look for second-order effects of those relationships. Then I'm able synthesize complex relationships into a coherent story for non-technical audience, with an emphasis on business impact.</p>

<p>I'm interested in market microstructure, order management and execution, asset allocation, portfolio optimization, algorithmic trading systems, interest rate models, and high-performance computing.</p>

works, the result is indisputable: ""This time it will surely run,"" or ""I just found the last bug.""</p>

<p>I know and use different computer languages (at least 10). My favorite and mostly used languages are C#, C and C++.<br/></p>

<p>I have intensive experience with Windows NT systems since October 1992 Beta of Windows NT 3.1. All time I tried study different Windows API and internals from both programming and administrative side. In 1993 I was one of the first beta testers on Microsoft SMS 1.0 in Europa with visits of developers in Redmond and so on. Since the time I know good problems of software installation and deployment.<br/></p>

<p>I worked long time as IT consulting (for large companies) for different technologies (mostly from Microsoft) in both back-end and front-end, but software development is my favor. Because of that I developed a lot of different tools for IT administrators. Since I have a daughter and later a son I implement mostly projects with software development to see more my family.<br/></p>

<p>In software development I developed different stuffs from driver development, NT services development up to COM, DCOM, RPC development and different Network technology.<br/></p>

<p>I have very broad spectrum of interest. Currently I mostly interesting in: WFC RESTfull services, ASP.NET MVC, Security, jQuery, jqGrid, JavaScript. I am a perfectionist and like searching and using of the best, optimizes technologies, which perfect match to the solving problem.<br/></p>

<p>I like to find and solve problems. Complex problems I like mostly. My typical projects are on the edge between software development and complex IT requirements from the administrative side.<br/></p>

<p>I think that there are no stupid questions, only different points of view. So I use only voting up and no voting down and try to help as more people as possible.<br/></p>

<p>Since more as 10 years I am self-employed. My own small company is OK soft GmbH.

<ol>
<li>Start with the lowest level, most frequently executed code first.</li>
<li>Having chosen a fixed set of data types, implement the code in assembly.</li>
<li>Reimplement the code in plain C, not using any abstract data types, so that it compiles into the same assembly instructions.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 with a few different sets of data types.</li>
<li>Take all of the C code from steps 2 and 4, and reimplement using C++ templates. Determine the template arguments.</li>
<li>Identify all of the non-type-based validations needed by the template function.</li>
<li>Identify all of the type-based validations needed by the template function.</li>
<li>Package the template function into a class template method, and implement the non-type-based validations as its methods.</li>
<li>Add the type-based validations to the class template.</li>
<li>Identify any types, ones that a programmer-user might be tempted to instantiate the class template with, 
and test whether this would result in undesirable effects. (See note for step 10.)</li>
<li>Implement additional type-based validations to guard against the scenarios identified in step 10.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note for step 10.</p>

<ul>
<li>Compiler errors (failure to build) is a desirable effect, if the usage is indeed ill-formed.</li>
<li>A successful build that results in an incorrect executable (one that produces incorrect 
result when executed) is the most severe undesirable effect.</li>
<li>An unsuccessful build that results in hard-to-understand compiler error messages is 
a mildly undesirable effect.</li>
<li>A source file that triggers compiler crashes (which may be possibly vendor-specific)
is also a mildly undesirable effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>I started programming in 8th grade, and I haven't stopped since. I started out with HTML (pseudo-programming really), moved to javascript, then to php and perl. I then dabbled in Java and C/C++ for a little. I then returned to php and am focusing on it now.</p>

Yes, I'm kinda old--but I feel young!</p>

<p>I became a certified public accountant out of college. But my computer interest overtook my profession when I computerized the entire bookkeeping department of the CPA form I worked for.  </p>

<p>Since then, I have balanced my business background with my computer interests by programming business management systems (you know, the big ""boring"" stuff like inventory, receivables, payables, payroll, management reports).  </p>

<p>Currently: I'm ""learning up"" on Photoshop+Illustrator.  I'm also sharpening skills on both the front and back ends of websites. </p>

<p>My current fascination is using Html's canvas and SVG to enhance user experiences.  I'm finding that boring information + interesting graphics = faster/better knowledge for the user.</p>

<p>My language of choice is anything C-ish but I'm most experienced in C#.</p>

<p>My credo in life is simple: ""Learn something new every day"".</p>

<hr />
<p>Molecular biologist and historian by formal training, but software developer by passion. Also now by career.</p>
<p>My deepest areas of expertise are the x86 microarchitecture and the Windows API, but my interests span multiple platforms and diverse disciplines. At work, I build embedded hardware and software to perform data-acquisition and real-time signal processing from sensors. I write most of my code in C++ or assembly these days. I also know C, C#, VB.NET, and VB 6. Passionate about developing robust, efficient systems.</p>
<p>I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and learn new things quickly. I've an excellent eye for quality and detail. I'm here because I find great reward in teaching others and because I want to make the Internet a better place.</p>
<p>I have strong ideas and make a habit of openly challenging assumptions. People don't like having their assumptions challenged, so this sometimes leads to confrontation. Nothing I say is meant to offend; please don't take it personally. Progress cannot happen without confrontation, so think for yourself and question everything. I write long answers, but I won't be offended if you don't read everything.</p>
<p>If you have a technical question you think I might be able to answer, please ask it on the site so that everyone may contribute and benefit. If you disagree with one of the actions I've taken as a moderator, please bring it up for discussion on <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/"">Meta Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

My interests include mathematics, algorithms, machine learning, HTML5 and 3D graphics. The programming languages I use most are C++, Python, JavaScript, bash and Unix power tools.
I started programming when I was 10 years old on a Russian clone of ZX Spectrum 48k with Basic and Z80 assembly language. That CPU was less powerful than an average microwave clock nowadays, yet it was so much fun. 
I am also very enthusiastic about open source, Linux and free (as in free speech) software. 
For living I build electronic trading systems.</p>

</a>
<p>Moderator  ♦  on <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com"">English Language and Usage</a> and Pro Tem ♦ on <a href=""http://portuguese.stackexchange.com"">Portuguese Language</a>.  I can most easily be reached in real time by pinging me in the <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/95/english-language-usage"">ELU chatroom</a>.</p>

<p>I’m Tom Christiansen, co-author of <em>Programming Perl</em> and <em>Perl Cookbook</em> from O’Reilly. I work for <a href=""http://www.grantstreet.com/careers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grant Street Group</a>, who are always looking to <strong>hire more Perl programmers</strong>. I can (sometimes) be reached via email at &lt;tchrist@perl.com&gt;, but that address is heavily spam-filtered so just because you sent me something doesn’t guarantee that I’ll’ve read it. I’ve lived in Colorado for the last quarter century, but have previously lived abroad in Spain and England. I try to spend as much time as I can in the Colorado mountains.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing Unix and C programming since the early 1980s. My programming interests include high-level languages, Unicode, regexes, and operating systems. My old <a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/407"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">O’Reilly bio</a> from ages ago mutters various ancient things about me, and some folks have gone and put up <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Christiansen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a silly Wikipedia page</a> about me, too. As a kid I lived down the street from <a href=""http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.10/cruise_pr.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gary Gygax</a> of Dungeons and Dragons fame, and worked for TSR throughout high school. I have ancient undergraduate degrees in Spanish and in Computer Science, plus a graduate degree in compsci focusing on operating systems design and in natural language processing. I’ve studied Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Latin, and German, along with a smattering of related languages thrown in.</p>

<p>The maxim that <em>“If you haven’t lost track of how many languages you’ve learned, you haven’t learned enough of them yet”</em> applies to both programming languages and natural languages alike.</p>

My grandfather was a Fortran programmer.</p>
<p>Sixteen years later, I was disappointed when my first PC came with no programming language, as that Internet thing looked fun. So I learnt JavaScript, and when the university refused to install Netscape LiveScript, I learnt Perl, which took me through my BA and MSc, and into freelance development until Node.JS fulfilled the Netscape dream.</p>
<p>Although I've tried, and studied with the best, I've yet to find a way to make a computer do what I really want to do — untraditional jazz, flamenco, and metal. When I'm not gardening, or smoking, that's what I find on the back burner.</p>

<p>The evolving nature of platforms means code will change in the future. In a perfect world these changes do not mean re-inventing the wheel, or function!

<p>I enjoy making things and building software. Not only apps, but the engines and frameworks they run on. The things I build must have a purpose, and a good one. Before accepting any job or project, I must come to accept/create a vision and direction in terms of positive impact in the world and society.</p>

<p>I'm a pragmatic business man, scientist, and thinker. Sometimes, I'm told by people no longer working next to me, a little too pragmatic. I have no time to spare and there is no dull moment in my life, because I like to squeeze the orange all the way.</p>

<p>Other than that, I'm a naturally fast-talking-coherent-cursing mthrfckr, which means I will not apologize to anyone for speaking to loud, or being a well-educated nuclear-passionate hot-blooded guy.</p>

But the way Stack Overflow works these days no longer seems to be about sharing knowledge, getting answers, and welcoming community.</p>
<p>Now your answers must be &quot;politically correct&quot; and complying to the highest nazi standards of those who didn't even ask for them, and who claim to know better than the original poster what's good for them. Often they even edited my answers and corrupted them from their original intended meaning, because of what <em>they</em> thought is a better answer. (Hey, if you think of a better answer, why don't you write your own? :q )</p>
<p>Same goes with questions: most of them are claimed as &quot;dumb&quot;, &quot;off topic&quot;, &quot;duplicate&quot;, or whatever lame excuse they can come up with to close/delete it. Especially when they can't answer the question themselves immediately with a canned response copy-pasted from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I don't like it that Stack Overflow has become just one huge middle-fingered RTFM / SEO link farm for Wikipedia, and I don't want to participate in it anymore. That's not the type of &quot;community&quot; I want to be part of.

I'm fluent in the ""full stack"" of web development: SQL databases, back-end languages (PHP, C#, Ruby, Python), front-end (HTML, CSS, Javascript), web platform (accessibility, usability, SEO, HTTP, REST), testing (TDD, unit/integration/acceptance), tooling (git, webpack, gulp, npm), and of course all the frameworks you can shake a stick at (React/Redux, Vue.js, jQuery, SASS, LESS, Bootstrap, Laravel, Rails, Silex, Slim, Flask, etc).</p>

<p>I am currently a software engineer at <a href=""https://www.wwt.com/application-services"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">World Wide Technology (Application Services)</a>, using agile methods to frequently deliver working software to large enterprise clients. I was formerly a senior developer and partner at <a href=""https://webconcentrate.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Web Concentrate</a>. Much of my prior experience is in agency environments -- building lots of marketing and eCommerce sites, usually on content management systems, always with a lot of communication and project management to facilitate ever-changing requirements and deadlines. I've also taught college classes on web development and created many helpful open source tools to make the life of other designers and developers easier.</p>

<p>No matter what I am working on, I'm always driven by a desire to provide a great user experience and a great developer experience.</p>

<p>I studied at the <a href=""https://scuolasuperiore.uniud.it/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scuola Superiore</a> of the University of Udine.
I've been interested in Computer Science since high school. Being pretty good at school I've enrolled in one of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_Graduate_Schools_in_Italy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Schools of Excellence</a> in Italy. In this institution I had the chance to follow many interesting courses not included in the standard CS curriculum: from Bioinformatics to Neural Networks, from Category Theory to Reverse Mathematics, from Logical Frameworks to Statistical Mechanics. During my enrollment I had to keep a very high mark score in my exams and I had periodic evaluation exams that taught me how to work and learn under pressure.</p>

<p>In the last 13 years I've been using quite a bit of <a href=""/questions/tagged/python"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python</a>, as you can see from my answers. In the last 3 years I have also been interested in functional programming, in particular in <a href=""/questions/tagged/haskell"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;haskell&#39;"" rel=""tag"">haskell</a>, and my Bachelor thesis project involved implementing <em>in</em> Haskell a type inferencer <em>for</em> Haskell inside an already existing research tool.</p>

<p>I have used <a href=""/questions/tagged/java"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;java&#39;"" rel=""tag"">java</a> during my Master thesis where I have implemented some advanced algorithms into an <a href=""http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pepa/tools/plugin/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">existing Eclipse plug-in</a> developed at the University of Edinburgh (my contribution has not been released yet).</p>

<p>Other languages I've used include: <a href=""/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> (in particular in relation with the <a href=""/questions/tagged/python-c-api"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python-c-api&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python-c-api</a>),<a href=""/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c++</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/kotlin"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;kotlin&#39;"" rel=""tag"">kotlin</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/go"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;go&#39;"" rel=""tag"">go</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/curry"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;curry&#39;"" rel=""tag"">curry</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/prolog"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;prolog&#39;"" rel=""tag"">prolog</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/javascript"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;"" rel=""tag"">javascript</a>.</p>

<p>Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
Simple is better than complex.<br>
Complex is better than complicated.<br>
Flat is better than nested.<br>
Sparse is better than dense.<br>
Readability counts.<br>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
Although practicality beats purity.<br>
Errors should never pass silently.<br>
Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br>
Now is better than never.<br>
Although never is often better than <em>right</em> now.<br>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</p>

After finding a book on C++ my father had left on the ground I was hooked into the world of programming. Being able to create something out of nothing but letters and symbols blew my mind. A computer could say my name! My recent passions have encompassed all that is considered ""Software""; from the roots of Business Development, through the customer interactions, all the way down to committing and reviewing code that contributes to a Sprint Backlog Item in the current Sprint. I love the feeling of a project coming together, team members organizing themselves to promote the best quality product, and developers walking away from any interaction feeling inspired and motivated. </p>

<p>While working as a software architect with an international software company that delivered capabilities to telecom, transportation, government organizations, I have been blessed with the opportunity to collaborate with a wide range of individuals and roles that has given me a well rounded sense of responsibility to the customers, share holders, executives and engineering.</p>

<p>As a engineer with not only the theoretical understanding of distributed computing, but one that has had numerous opportunities to work hands on with designing, implementing and deploying scalable, highly available, distributed software platforms able to deliver enterprise class reliability, I am excited to see where the Digital world takes us. The Internet-of-Things is then small step in our worlds evolution of mixing human ingenuity with the collective knowledge of our ancestors.</p>

<p>I take a holistic approach to software development; bare-metal, comms infrastructure, programming languages, and all the obvious (and less-obvious) dependencies can make a huge difference to achieving mission objectives - i.e. producing something that works reliably, does whatever it's supposed to, and is maintainable/supportable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For every natural phenomenon there are different levels of
  explanation. I like to call these ""why"" values. For the first value of
  why, the question ""Why is the sky blue?"" can be answered with some
  simple hand-waving about light from the sun passing through our
  planet's atmosphere. For a value of why + 2 (also known to parents as,
  ""But whyyyyy?"") you have to start talking about the fact that light
  comes in different colors. </p>

<p>Full-stack programmer.</p>

<p><strong>Rust</strong> programmer since 2015. My favorite language.</p>

<p><strong>Angular/JS</strong> fan and developer since 2011 (from pre-1.0 stage),<br>
<strong>PHP</strong> backend programmer since 2004.
Like to write clean OOP code with unit-tests.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies, apps and services I have experience with</strong>: SOA, REST, AngularJS, PHP, Ionic, D3, Jasmine, Protractor, Twitter Bootstrap, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Beanstalk, Mandrill, PayPal, Stripe, AWS APIs, Git, Travis CI...</p>

<p><strong>Things I'd like to get more experience with</strong>: AI, HTML5 Media (audio, video, canvas).</p>

<p><strong>Things I don't want to work with</strong>: MS SQL, CoffeeScript.</p>

<p>Very passionate to work with Rust.</p>

<p>I think unit-tests are essential for code evolution. There is no code without need to evolution. TDD helps to build modular and easy maintainable system. Time, spent to writing tests is much less than time that will be spent to debug.</p>

<p>Have a lot of experience with caching (also with semaphores, preventing dog-pile and race condition effects). I wrote an PHP-wrapper for Redis, published on <a href=""http://redis.io/clients#PHP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">redis.io</a> and successfully working with high load, getting thankful feedback from programmers who use it. 
Like to optimize performance of algorithms and applications.</p>

<p>Time of developer's work costs more than server's resources. Page must be generated fast, should have minimum full page reloads, minimum http-requests - all for user's comfort.</p>

<p>My favorite books are '<a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0132350882"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Clean code</a>', '<a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0321127420"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>' and '<a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1590599098"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PHP Objects, Patterns, and Practice</a>' . Also, I like ideas of <a href=""http://misko.hevery.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Miško Hevery</a>.<br>
I like and respect <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SOLID</a> principles, <a href=""http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hexagonal architecture</a>, MVC pattern, and, especially, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Separation of concerns</a> (it's not all bookshelf, just most important for me).</p>

<p>But very soon after Half-Life was released and then all I wanted was to be a level designer, so I spent the next 8 years learning various 3D and graphics applications. Once I hit about 20 years old I realised I could make better tools, so I downloaded Eclipse and started to learn Python, and then C++.  It wasn't long before I forgot all about making content, and focussed all my efforts on programming. Never looked back.</p>

I am also a certified PMP as well.  I enjoy new opportunities and experiences.  Right now I am located in Pennsylvania but I would love to move south someday soon.</p>

<p>I have spent most of my time in the Microsoft stack (starting with VBA and VB6 as well as SQL Server 7).  I moved to .NET when it came out and Microsoft SQL Server has always been my primary database platform.  However, I have developed applications professionally in a number of languages including PHP, C++, C, Powershell, etc.</p>

<p>Right now I am spending most of my time in JavaScript, primarily in Angular. I love the flexibility and power of modern JavaScript. It allows me to create really great interactive websites and I can create prototypes or even whole applications for mobile devices without changing languages.</p>

<p>If I had to pick one thing I was best at, I would say that it is probably identifying solutions to problems, even if those problems haven't been identified as problems.  I am skilled at deconstructing issues and identifying a good path to solve each issue on the way to solving the entire problem.  This serves me well in software development but it also applies to a lot of non-development areas.  That is why currently I am a certified project manager and the head of an IT department.  I find problems and I solve them.  I have been able to be creative in how I solved networking problems, server problems, and other IT-related problems.  This has given me great success in my many different roles over the years and it has given me a broad base of experiences to help improve my analytical abilities.</p>

<p>I love to hear from people, so feel free to give me a shout.  My email address is listed.  Drop me a line and say hi.</p>

<p>After spending some time, reading the questions, here on StackOverflow, I have to admit that, at least about humans, he was right.</p>

<p>I'm good in <strong>downvoting</strong> your questions. I'm downvoting question like:</p>

<ul>
<li>retrive location on Android</li>
<li><strong>NullPointerException</strong> in own code(for FSM sake! use debugger!)</li>
<li><strong>NetworkOnMainThreadException</strong> (search first ask later)</li>
<li><strong>JSON parsing</strong> <s>on Android</s> in Java(search first ask later)</li>
<li><strong>What is the best way to ...?</strong></li>

In particular coding, security, infrastructure and hardware. I also happen to like making users happy, which usually has the positive effect of making a business successful.</p>
<p>I consider myself a middleware / back-end developer and my main professional programming language is Java. In the past I've coded in C (including some of Linux kernel hacking), Smalltalk and Lisp... and basic (old Atari 2600 if you must know). I code for fun in other languages (Ruby, JS, Kotlin and Scala) and I've tried learning a few other ones but failed as I got distracted by other things (Haskell and Erlang one day I shall conquer you!)</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm learning Kubernetes with the aim to simplify micro-services platforms (not that a micro-service architecture is the perfect solution for any problems). In the past, I worked with Ansible and Terraform (and puppet in a previous life) after all, who wants to configurea fleet of servers by hand?</p>
<p>I'm quite lazy, which means that I need to automate everything that is repetitive and/or dull (I'm a Maven lover! There' I said it!) and I get a bit restless when a seasoned developer codes without using shortcuts (life is too short to see you how you dance with a mouse to hit the &quot;run tests&quot; button!).</p>

He sold is first commercial application at age 12 (an installer kit for DOS applications) for a whopping $100. Although he attended the Worcester Polytechnic Institute for four years his attendance left much to be desired and he never graduated.  Fortunately, he discovered a security hole in Internet Explorer in 1998 and parlayed that into a Microsoft internship that lasted seven years.  In 2005 he left Microsoft to found his first startup where he built what became Google Desktop Gadgets.  After the requisite post-acquisition stint at Google, a trip around the world, and a couple of years consulting for Seattle area startups, Geoffrey's entrepreneurial spirit came out of remission.  He is currently a founding partner at two Seattle startups.</p>

<p>My pet -hobby- open source project (in artificial intelligence, for Linux) is <a href=""http://refpersys.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RefPerSys</a> (still unfunded in august 2020, and done with others). I dream to have more time to devote to it. You'll make me happy by compiling it on your Linux box, and give feedback; Contact me for potential applications or funding opportunities.</p>
<p>I am an enthusiast of free software, and know quite well Linux (which I am using since 1994)</p>
<p>I think that high-level languages are important, and that declarative knowledge-based systems should be more used (see <a href=""http://bootstrappingartificialintelligence.fr/WordPress3/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">J.Pitrat's blog</a> ...)</p>
<p>You might contact me by an email to <code>basile</code> <em>at</em> <code>starynkevitch</code> <em>dot</em> <code>net</code> but please <em>give the URL of your question</em> in your message.</p>
<p>I am French,I am a man (born in 1959), a husband, a grand father, and have a PhD in CS (artificial intelligence, 1990, Paris LIP6) and graduated from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_Paris-Saclay"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ENS Cachan</a>.</p>

<p>I have worked on more than a few web applications mostly using node and I'm quite well versed in node.js and Javascript. I also know my way around in command line. Talking about command line, I prefer Unix(I'm an Ubuntu user, but I'd also love OS X). I don't use vim anymore, but the habit is still there and working in an IDE without proper vim key bindings feels like I'm digging my grave with my bare hands. :)</p>

<p><strong>Top PHP issues I see on SO and my suggestions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/14110189/788192"">Stop using <code>mysql_*</code> functions. They are deprecated.</a> Instead, look into using <code>PDO</code> along with binding values. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1179874/what-is-the-difference-between-bindparam-and-bindvalue"">Be aware that <code>bindValue</code> and <code>bindParam</code> work differently.</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/31943849/788192"">Stop using time stamps. Use the <code>DateTime</code> object instead.</a> Convert all of your time stamps in tables to the <code>DATETIME</code> type as well. You'll no longer have to worry about which PHP architecture you're on and you'll have a plethora of functionality readily available instead of writing your own.</li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/17497184/788192"">You can pass external variables into a closure's scope</a>, along with the ability to modify it (if passed by reference using <code>&amp;</code>), by using the <code>use</code> keyword. Example:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>$externalVar = 10;  print_r(array_map(function($value) use (&amp;$externalVar) {  $externalVar++;  return $value * $externalVar;  }, range(1, 10)));</code></p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li>Use CSRF tokens in your forms! And clear them after single use! <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/17244070/788192"">Old laravel example</a></li>
<li>If Google PageSpeed docks your score for analytics, then <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/41065130/788192"">cheat back</a>!</li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags"">You can't parse [X]HTML with regex. Because HTML can't be parsed by regex. Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML.</a></li>

<p>Chinese characters on my username and profile picture are normally censored by the Chinese government, but this had to be said.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/361486"">REMARK CENSORED BY Stack Exchange FOR POLITICAL CORRECTNESS</a>. Upvote that question. I asked if I could make fun of dictators, as I've been doing since 2015 with Xi Jinping, and no one replied because it would be politically incorrect to say no, so I'll continue until told otherwise. See also <a href=""https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/#politically-incorrect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/#politically-incorrect</a></p>
<p>I like some of Trump's anti-CCP policies, but not sure I'd vote for him.</p>
<p>The &quot;USA First&quot; stance is particularly damaging as it scares USA allies away.</p>
<p>I don't think there's enough evidence for the electoral fraud allegations.</p>
<p>But makes the US more like a dictatorship... more like China.</p>
<p>And those who were silenced will only have more motivation, and the risk of terrorism is greatly increased.</p>
<p>The people must decide what is true. Not big companies. Individuals must be able to express their beliefs, always.</p>
<p>If you think a group of people is a bunch of idiots who believe fake news, then, tough, that's democracy for you. Maybe it means that your government is not investing enough in education and welfare to properly educate and give hope to those people.</p>

<p>The quickest way to describe me is based on what I care about: I care about technology, I care about people and the way technology enables business.</p>

<p>I care a lot about providing ent to end solutions, with journeys beginning on user's device, be that a mobile or a desktop device, or even simply an IoT device, along with everything that is needed for the solution to be long-term feasible and scalable. </p>

<p>I really like working with large scale agile architectures, infrastructures and software which adapt easily to business needs.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, I also care a lot about people working in tech and due to this I take part in a lot of mentoring and hiring. It is one of the most rewarding outcomes to see someone be successful and to know that you have contributed to that a bit.</p>

<p>Another very important domain I deeply care about is agility, specifically Scrum. I really enjoy working like that but also migrating teams which have little experience with Scrum is something that motivates me quite a lot.</p>

<p>Languages by approximate amount of time I've spent with each (last updated in March 2015):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Python / Boo</code>: 8 years (work and personal)

<ul>
<li>Don't tell the other languages, but this is definitely my favorite one so far. Everything is so compact and easy to read. Plus I love that 90% of tools you need are packaged in the standard library and that the next 9% are easy to install with <code>Pip</code>. Writing that last 1% is easy.</li>
<li><code>Boo</code> is Unity's variation on <code>Python</code>. It's compiled so includes more type safety than standard <code>Python</code>... it's compatible with Mono and .NET.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>JavaScript / JQuery / UnityScript</code>: 8 years (work and personal)

<ul>
<li>Unity will try telling you their language is <code>JavaScript</code>. It has enough changes that I generally refer to it as its own language, <code>UnityScript</code>. I've made some web games in it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Java / Groovy</code>: 7 years (work and personal)

<ul>
<li>I've made web apps, swing apps, and Android apps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Objective-C</code>: 7 years (work and personal)

<ul>
<li>Multiple apps on the iOS and Mac App stores.</li>
<li>I love that all arguments are named, but this language often ends up with unwieldy lines. I've yet to see any particularly good style conventions that are easy to read/write and compact for this language. <code>@property</code>, <code>@()</code>, <code>@[]</code>, and <code>@{}</code> were a nice start, but the language still has a long way to go before it even competes in the same readability league as <code>Python</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>PL/SQL</code>: 5 years (work)

<ul>
<li>I've found that I have a knack for optimizing SQL scripts to run far quicker... in my experience, scripts tend to run slowly because people use <code>join</code> much more often than they should.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>C/C++/C#</code>: 3 years (work, school and personal)

<ul>
<li>I switched entirely to using <code>C#</code> in Unity after support for <code>Boo</code> was dropped a few years ago. The language has really grown on me - Microsoft clearly started with <code>Java</code>, stripped out a lot of legacy junk, and added in a lot of nicer new features. I'd love a job where I get to use it.</li>
<li>Played around with OGRE 3D (Object Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) before settling on <code>Unity</code>, instead. Also, most class programming assignments called for <code>C++</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Racket / Scheme / LISP</code>: 1 year (school and personal)

<ul>
<li>I really like how consistent the syntax is. If anyone ever says they don't like these languages, they've either not tried it or they don't understand functional programming.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

"918394","730","2011-08-29 18:57:44","John DeRegnaucourt","2020-10-23 17:58:18","","Dayton, OH","<p>I have been developing software since 1980.  I started with BASIC on the Radio Shack TRS-80, moved to Z80 assembly, writing commercial games for it.  I developed software in Pascal, C, and C++ in college (earned a BS in CS from Wright State University).  I've worked with computer graphics (OpenGL) and heavily used the Graphics Gems books.</p>

<p>I started in Java in 1996 as a hobby.  In 1999, I switched from the C++ Microsoft world to the Sun (now Oracle) world with Java.  I have worked on all tiers of distributed systems, from User interfaces in applets using Swing, and now HTML 5.  I am very proficient in CSS, Javascript, and HTML.  On the web tier, I typically use Tomcat (version 7).  I would rate myself near-expert on tomcat configuration.  I've written a Java serializer to serialize Java to / from JSON in support of 'command pattern' (RESTful) web apps.  See <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/json-io/"" rel=""nofollow"">json-io</a> on Google code.</p>

<p>I also developed JsonCommandServlet (yet to be listed on Google Code or Source Forge, but forth coming).  This is a small RESTful servlet akin to Spring MVC (but much easier to use and configure).</p>

<p>I have worked extensively with databases, most proficient with MySQL.  I manage a very large MySQL instance for support of a distributed file system backing a cloud storage website.  Having the responsibility to support a high throughput website has really honed my coding practices around error handling, logging, (managing signal to noise in log files), as well as sharped my skills in performance tuning (managing HTTP headers, compression, caching, load balancing, build stateless servers, etc.)</p>

<p>I am currently developing NCube, an 'N' dimensional HyperCube.  It supports any number of axis, with any number of columns per axis, and cells that can be of any type. Also studying using Node.js to back the visual editor.</p>

<p>Key observations: </p>

<ul>
<li>Always build automated tests for your code.  Keep test coverage at 100% method and 90%+ for line coverage.  </li>
<li>Always keep the web-tier stateless.  Makes clustering simple.</li>
<li>Stay away from modeling your domain objects in Java objects when your system has a sophisticated domain model.  Java classes do not natively support configuration (scoping rules like date effectivity, geographical relevance, business unit, etc.) </li>
<li>Embrace 'thick' HTML 5 clients.  Use the 'sessionStorage' feature of HTML 5.  Layer your HTML 5 client at a minimum of view (HTML) and controller (Javascript) augmented with JQuery.  Look at Google's angular for finer grained layering on the UI side.</li>
<li>Some freebies I've created: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/deep-equals/"" rel=""nofollow"">DeepEquals / DeepHashcode</a> and <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/safe-simple-date-format/"" rel=""nofollow"">SafeSimpleDateFormat</a> which provides a ThreadSafe DateFormat instance.</li>
<li>Having used Spring and Hibernate extensively, I can say that the Spring framekwork is great and Hibernate is not.  </li>

<p>Work in progress—I really want to add more here. By far the greatest thrill I get on Stack is when I read an answer that makes me go ""Aha!..."" and grasp a way of doing things that is so much more efficient than anything I had come up with. I've been blown away quite a few times. And one thing that's for sure is there's no shortage here of people who are a lot brighter than me. :)</p>

To pretend to know when you do not know is a disease</p>

<p>The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy</p>

<p>The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool</p>

<p>He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to 
be captured by them</p>

<p>In dispelling ignorance, it is not favorable to act as an enemy</p>

<p>To bear with fools in kindliness brings good fortune</p>

<p>In punishing folly
It does not further one
To commit transgressions
The only thing that furthers
Is to prevent transgressions</p>

<p>All day long the superior man is creatively active
At nightfall his mind is still beset with cares</p>

<p>If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead, he goes astray;
But if he follows, he finds guidance.</p>

<p>The superior man understands the signs of the time and prefers to desist</p>

<p>The wisdom of a learned man cometh by opportunity of leisure; and he that hath little business shall become wise</p>

<p>You are equal to others, but you are not better</p>

<p>Quiet perseverance brings good fortune</p>

<p>Look to your conduct and weigh the favorable signs
When everything is fulfilled, supreme good fortune comes</p>

<p>Know what is in front of your face, and what is hidden from you will be disclosed to you.</p>

<p>Don't let your heart get big because of your knowledge. Take counsel with the ignorant as well as with the scholar</p>

<p>The greatest epiphany can be lost to the simplest distraction</p>

<p>The surest way to remember something is to give it rhythm</p>

<p>Earnestness is the path of immortality, thoughtlessness the path of death</p>

<p>Physical objects are not in space, but these objects are spatially extended</p>

<p>And that you remit the debt as alms. That would be better for you if you understand</p>

<p>The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay</p>

<p>It's a curious thing about our industry: not only do we not learn from our mistakes, we also don't learn from our successes</p>

<p>The tools we use have a profound influence on our thinking habits, and therefore, on our thinking abilities</p>

<p>There will never be a universal programming language since no one language is best for all problems</p>

<p>Now I realize that I am the power that commands the feeling of my mind and from which circumstances grow</p>

<p>Remember that man created method, and method did not create man, and do not strain yourself in twisting into someone’s preconceived pattern, which unquestionably would be appropriate for him, but not necessarily for you</p>

<p>What is not subject to choice is fact</p>

<p>It's not that the malicious code <code>understands</code>, they just need to match a pattern</p>

<p>1 &#215; 0; he who falls on this stone will be broken</p>

<p>1 &#247; 0; but on whomever it falls, it will grind them to powder</p>

<p>I currently do virtually all my coding in Java since, thanks to <a href=""https://robovm.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RoboVM</a> and <a href=""http://www.gwtproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GWT</a>, it allows me to develop for almost all platforms: Android, iOS, Blackberry, web, desktop, ..., and even BluRay!</p>

<p>Having taught myself how to program since the 1980s, I still value the old-school approach of paying excruciating attention to performance for every line of code that I write. I like coding as close to the metal as possible to have as much control over my applications as I possibly can. Luckily, neither RoboVM nor GWT nor Java fundamentally interfere with this once you understand how they work behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I sold my first applications when I was still in school, and Windows was just a fancy add-on to DOS :)</p>

<p>I've been doing software development professionally for the last 17 years, and informally for 5-6 years before that. </p>

<p>In my career as a software developer, I moved up the chain quite quickly, did my own thing for a few years, and even employed some people to help me service my customers. Since then I've been exposed to a lot of technologies incl. SQL, Delphi, C#, WCF and a lot more.</p>

<p>Software Development is more than just a job for me, and I hope to be able to do it for free one day.</p>

<p>Check out <a href=""http://www.dima.to/blog/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my blog</a>, where I post some interesting technical findings of interest.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what makes me successful in general programming or development, but to any newcomers to this blood-sport, my best guess would be that success in programming comes from some strange combination of <strong>interest</strong>, <strong>persistence</strong>, <strong>patience</strong>, <strong>instincts</strong> (for example, someone might tell you that something can't be done a certain way, but you just know that can't be true, or you look at a piece of code and know something doesn't seem right with it at first glance, but you can't quite put your finger on it until you think it through some more), <strong>fearlessness of tinkering</strong>, and an ability to <strong>take advice</strong> on Stack Overflow because you should be <strong>humble</strong>. Its okay to be wrong or to have a bad approach, realize it, and try to find a better one, and even better to be wrong and find a better approach to solve something than to have had a bad approach to begin with. There is merit to every question, doubt, and morsel of understanding that we desire to gain out of anything we want to know. Knowledge is at the heart of Stack Overflow and I've personally gained a lot of it from this site, this technical history book that helps users learn from past mistakes so they don't recreate them in the future. I hope that whatever fragments of information I sprinkle across here help those who hit the same roadblocks.</p>

I have been associated with the software industry for the past 5+ years. Over the years I have developed competencies in the following technologies and paradigms: </p>

<ul>
<li>Web Design  </li>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>PHP Site Development</li>
<li>Wordpress Site Development</li>
<li>Joomla Site Development</li>
<li>Js / Jquery /AngularJs</li>
<li>Css / Css3  AJAX Work</li>
<li>XML/JSON</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
</ul>

<p>I find myself to be an adherent believer of the proverb “Never Give Up”. I understand that the world of software engineering is rapidly evolving and is highly competitive. A software engineer needs to be always on his toes to keep up with the emerging trends, styles and technologies of the software industry. I learn fast, adapt quickly and have acquainted myself with many cutting edge development tools. Website Design and Development is not just a profession, for me it is also a passion.</p>

<p>Now they have <code>next(takewhile(not_, count()))</code> problems.</p>

<hr>

<p>Since I've been asked about this multiple times now:</p>

<p>It's a reference to <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/06/regular-expressions-now-you-have-two-problems.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Now they have two problems""</a> about regular expressions. <code>next(takewhile(not_, count()))</code> is guaranteed to give you <code>0</code>, and pretty efficiently… but it's not exactly readable. Which is the joke. <code>itertools</code> <em>does</em> solve all your problems, but you don't <em>always</em> need to use it.</p>

<p>If you don't grasp the paradigm, go read <a href=""http://www.dabeaz.com/generators-uk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">David Beazley's presentations</a>. Once you do: ""I've got a CSV, and I want to group the rows by…"" Pass a <code>csv.reader</code> to <code>groupby</code>. ""I've got a bunch of values, and I want to take them 4 at a time and…"" Use <code>grouper</code> from the recipes. ""I've got a file, and I want to take each pair of adjacent lines and…"" <code>tee</code> it, <code>next</code> one copy, and <code>zip</code> them. And so on.</p>

<p>But of course some problems have an even <em>easier</em> solution, and once you start thinking in terms of sequences of transformations on iterators, sometimes you'll miss the easier answer.</p>

<p>(The exact same thing happens with <code>numpy</code>, of course.)</p>

In 1980 I founded a consulting company I ran until 2005; during that time I worked with a wide variety of applications, organizations, and technical environments.  I'm now with VMware as a PostgreSQL engineer, and tech lead for use of PostgreSQL within their products.  I'm a committer for the free, open source version of PostgreSQL, and an active member of that community.</p>

<p>By far the largest patch I've worked on for PostgreSQL has been the Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) implementation which went into PostgreSQL version 9.1.  This was a joint project with Dan R.K. Ports of MIT, with helpful input and support from many in the PostgreSQL community.  Our paper on that effort can be found here:</p>

<p>More recently I've added support for creating and refreshing materialized views to PostgreSQL, and am in the process of adding support for incremental maintenance based on the view's declaration.</p>

I believe that such a product can only be created by people who share an enthusiasm for what they're doing. I think that when you're doing something with passion, you can reach the highest point of efficiency in your work. I don't want to be managed by someone who's called manager, but want to be driven by a leader, I can learn a lot from.</p>

<p>I have already gathered some experience both testing and developing web- and mobile applications which are used by millions people around the globe. During that time, I've worked with many programming languages including Java, Python, C++ and various test automation frameworks including Selenium Webdriver, Robot Framework and JBehave.</p>

<p>I'm always open for new challenges and experiences as software tester or software engineer in test in an agile environment, where the people are really passionate about what they are doing and ideally eat their own dog food. The companies like Github, 37Signals, Valve and Automattic have a similar culture to what I'm looking for. But first of all I'm looking for a great team of enthusiasts which love to deliver value to their customers.</p>

I tend to study the &quot;unit vectors&quot; of programming language diversity, such as Forth, Haskell and JavaScript (there are many), for fun. Every once in a while I learn a new language and at least solve a few Project Euler problems with it. Esoteric programming languages have a special place, partly because I challenge myself to implement them.</p>
<p>I answer questions of fellow developers, and contribute to open source software in general, because I believe that this is a great way to help our planet move forward. We share knowledge and we maximize the odds that our hard engineering efforts can continue to benefit the common good into the far future.</p>

Currently, I am trying to break into the hardware/firmware development world.  I just <em>love</em> pushing the boundaries of languages and hardware.</p>

<p>I know a variety of languages, as esoteric as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">prolog</a> and as recent as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C#</a> and as difficult as <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/libs/preprocessor/doc/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C/C++ macro</a> and <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/libs/mpl/doc/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C++ template</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>meta programming</em></a>, which are more like libraries to manipulate code generation.</p>

<p>Sometimes I find that employers fail to realize is that learning languages is easy, libraries a little more difficult, but learning how to learn is something that most people don't have.  Being able to break down a system into its components and building it up again is a critical skill that should be recognised.</p>

<p>I have worked with a lot of technologies, from home-computer BASIC and assembly to C to Ruby and JavaScript. I would cautiously say that the language that most excites me currently is Clojure, but I'm open to lots of things.</p>

<p>I like learning about how things from one perspective or paradigm are implemented in another, e.g. object-oriented behavior out of a procedural language like C. The functional worldview seems like one I would be well-served to really take the time to learn and practice.</p>

<p>My day-to-day personal computing setup is in Mac OS X, but I also use a Linux desktop as a backup server and for general tinkering; and I use Windows 7 at work. I feel pretty comfortable in all three.</p>

<p>I haven't been terribly active on StackExchange lately, but I'm hoping to remedy that, as long as I don't let it overshadow actual coding.</p>

<p><em>Remembering that I'll be dead soon, is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in Life.
Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure, these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
Remembering that you are going to die, is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
You are already naked, there is no reason not to follow your heart.</em></p>

Craziness is for the young.</p>

<p>I do mostly custom code dev (desktop apps for SMEs, or middleware). Got interested recently in mobile apps, and despite my undying love for Blackberry phones (that's the corporate drone speaking), I code mostly in Phonegap for Android and sometimes iOS. I have a bunch of code on Google Code, which I guess I should move to GitHub – all the more so since git is my weapon of choice.</p>

<p>I do Java/C code only with a gun to my head – but Android is good at dragging me back in Java-land. Python preferred for non-critical apps. GUI apps mostly in RealStudio (and C glue code in dylibs). Erlang when I want to make my CPUs overheat and scream past the competition ;-)</p>

<p>I'm Morwenn. You might have come across my profile near a C++ question. That wouldn't be surprising since I am almost always toying in a dark corner of your bedroom with some modern C++ features (don't be afraid :p); I gave up keeping the actual C++ version I'm using up-to-date in this description, but it should be the latest version available, any time, plus some experimental features. I sometimes try to contribute to the C++ standard and occasionally help with open-source projects.</p>

<p>When I'm not torturing templates, I develop some small scripts or applications with Python. Once in a while it doesn't hurt, and Sphinx is definitely the best thing that happened to project documentation. I also have a disturbing sorting fetish and have thus developed a generic C++14 library with many sorting algorithms, either stolen or reimplemented by myself; if you're interested, don't hesitate to <a href=""https://github.com/Morwenn/cpp-sort"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">check it out</a>.</p>

<p>Let's talk about hobbies now? :) I love to listen to music all day long while doing anything - psytrance is a must while programming. I also love to talk about music and to play music. I have been playing the recorder in a celtic metal band for some time now, that's plenty of fun ^^</p>

<p>Whatever, I don't know what to add. You can check my GitHub if you feel like it, there are some modern C++ libraries and other pseudo-random stuff over there. Anyway, have a good day and have fun programming, that's what matters the most! :)</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</strong> if you ever want to use code from one of my questions or answers, unless that code wasn't originally mine (I generally specify where the code comes from when needed), just do whatever you want with it. Consider it to be Creative Commons CC0 licensed (public domain).</em></p>

  If you want to become an expert programmer, google SOLID, buy GOF, buy POEAA, buy Clean Code, learn Refactoring, lookup GRASP, DDD, CQRS, DCI … but dont ask for PHP books. That's the most reasonable suggestion I can give you when you ask for Expert PHP books really.</p>

<li>Q: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/30676839/1774667"">Does SFINAE actually work with class templates?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>the answer seems to be ""actually, nope, but nobody noticed"".</p>

<p>An amusing link:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/reputation"">http://stackoverflow.com/reputation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>which will show your reputation history on stack overflow, if you like that kind of thing.</p>

<p>I started coding when I was around 14 and I am extremely passionate about it. I started coding in BASIC and then went on with Assembler and Turbo Pascal. In 1997 I started developing commercial applications using Microsoft Access. Since 2001 I’m developing exclusively for the web and never looked back to “traditional” coding ever since.</p>

<p>I am a perfectionist and a control freak and that is why I usually do all the work in a project except the actual graphic design. I have 10 years of experience using PHP and MySQL. I have 6 years of experience using MooTools but of recently I switched to jQuery due to its popularity (but still, MooTools kicks jQuery’s ass). Also, I have 10 years of experience with HTML/CSS. I am into web site performance optimization (both server- and client-side) and also a “best practices” evangelist.</p>

<p>In my work I rely heavily on the open source projects that I work on at <a href=""http://stefangabos.ro/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://stefangabos.ro/</a> and my own MVC-based micro PHP framework.</p>

<p>I can’t copy &amp; paste other’s code. I am coder: I code.</p>

<p>When I am not working I enjoy playing the guitar, sleeping, cooking, watching Formula One or a good movie.</p>

<p>When working, I listen to massive amounts of music – alternative rock, in general.</p>

<p>I am currently head of developers at Kubis Interactive – a results and client oriented U.S.-owned web agency with a Global presence, including branches in USA, South America, and Romania, with the ability to develop and implement measurable creative ideas, concepts, and strategies.</p>

Focused on front-end currently, but working in a company with lots of proprietary frameworks it tends to mean more focus on requirements honing and working directly with product. I do not work in machine learning but do have the responsibility of delivering massive amounts of data to our customers across visualizations and giant, configurable reports. I do interviews too and often train people for technical interview prep as a hobby (i.e. not for hire, not endorsed by my parent company, not with any structure or rhyme or reason, but happy to help). I am most familiar with Java and Javascript and aspire to learn C++ as done at Google, and Python.</p>

<p>I am also a part time masters student at Columbia studying computer science, with a likely focus on Machine Learning.</p>

<p><strong>Being engaged:</strong> I aspire to be an approachable person politically but will admit I have found a lot to oppose in our new president :) so I focus on training progressives to engage in constructive political dialogue, including such forgotten skills as ""listening,"" ""not calling people racist when you don't know what else is wrong with their viewpoint"" and so forth. I get plenty of practice with my own family and some of my peers! But really, we went astray with trolling Internet arguments and shouting matches at family gathering. Black lives do matter, but I personally can forgive someone if they need to sit down and talk about why and have some, ahem, skeptical questions.</p>

<p><strong>Misc hobbies</strong>: Aspiring rock climber. Mostly I complain about my climbing gym but have great access to Central Park and have followed in the Gunks. I believe in productivity-as-a-hobby and focus on writing, messing around with bullet journals, etc.</p>

<p>I like to answer questions on Spark, Hadoop, Big Data and Scala.  I'm pretty good at Bash, git and Linux, so I can sometimes answer these questions too.</p>

<p>I've stopped checking my filters for new questions these days, so I'm probably not answering questions which I probably could.  Therefore if you think I can help, especially with Spark and Scala, then rather than me give me email out, please comment on a similar question/answer of mine with a link.</p>

<p>Furthermore cross-linking similar questions can be nice for general SO browsing and good for SEO.</p>

I have 20+ years experience as a professional engineer, the last 6+ of which have been in iOS, and have a background in Computer Science.  </p>

<p>I have worked on interesting projects in both Swift (my focus since its release), as well as Objective-C.  Some recent projects include Ava, a novel app that helps deaf people communicate in group conversations, Twine, an app that helps people start and develop savings plans, and an internal hospital management app for a hospital chain, backed by GraphQL.</p>

<p>I have experience in getting existing applications back on track, and also in starting new applications from scratch.  From all my professional engineering experience, I have come to appreciate the lasting benefits of clean architecture, and that is my primary focus.  Accordingly, I have experience with applications of MVVM, reactive and unidirectional flow architectures, and have written foundational logic for multi-party chat and distributed systems, caching and connecting to REST and GraphQL backends.</p>

<p>Beyond my experience in iOS development, I have extensive experience in audio and video processing, system software development, and several years of backend web development. </p>

<p>Started out in the late 1980s using PL/1, moved to using COBOL with CICS, then back to PL/1 but with DB2. Short while using Toolbook then VB1 before back to mainframes and using PL/1 with CICS, DB2, Datacom, etc. Landed up using Oracle databases along with VB6. VB .NET came along so I used that with MSSQL for a while (and MS Access....), but gently migrated towards using php and MySQL.</p>

I did this in 1975, with the help of a library book on ALGOL 68, and without access to a computer. Eventually I enlisted the help of a student next door, who took my handwritten code, converted it to punch cards, and ran it on the University computer... The next week, he returned with the printout of a 49x49 magic square - and so a passion was born.

I presented various visual and mechanosensory stimuli to flies using custom-built hardware, and I simultaneously measured their behavioral and neural responses. To acquire data I relied heavily on hardware from Phidgets, Arduino, Stock-drive Products, and other hobbyist places, as well as custom software written mostly in Python. These days, I analyze data almost exclusively in Python, relying heavily on Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, and scikit-learn.</p>

<p>I like to practice solving challenging problems. Programming is very interesting because you are giving command to an entity (computer) that performs billions of tasks per second reliably. All my life, when bugs happen, never once the mistake was because the CPU computed wrongly. It's always my mistake or some other programmers' mistake. That's why I like computers. They never make mistakes, and they are never tired. You cannot blame them much, at least in my experience.</p>

<li>Reinstating her as a moderator if that be her wish.</li>

<ol>
<li>volunteer</li>
<li>hammer duplicate questions</li>
<li>ask others to add explanations to their code-only answers</li>
<li><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/296481/352329"">ask others not to provide solutions as comments</a></li>
<li>ask others not to post answers to questions that are incomplete, duplicates, or otherwise close-able.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't play the ""Fastest Gun In The West"" game, so when you see me post a late answer, it is because I have something valuable to offer and I hope that you will acknowledge the care that I take.</p>

<p>I use the StackExchange mobile app to receive instant notifications when I am mentioned in a comment.  This enables me to provide timely responses and better serve SE communities.</p>

<p>Now been unemployed for 19 years+, despite the alleged &quot;skills shortage&quot; and the &quot;efforts&quot; of websites, more than twenty &quot;recruitment agents&quot; and an entire government department. Employers prefer to engage a &quot;new grad&quot; who's &quot;up-to-date&quot; you see. They're &quot;easier to train&quot; (ie. they're cheaper and don't have the experience to tell the boss he's an idiot.)</p>
<p>So - I don't mind solving even dumb and obvious problems. Keeps what's left of my grey-matter from solidifying. At least people who place questions here have the wit to do so, unlike the average &quot;computer expert&quot; waving a &quot;qualification&quot; obtained on the demographics plan...</p>
<p>I've now lost interest in computing in general since the world only wants &quot;qualified&quot; cowboys who treat technical issues as some bizarre variety of popularity contest.</p>
<p>I was away from SO for a while because of the power-drunk noobie mods. I've now decided to ignore them.</p>
<p>...but they continue to plague me.</p>
<p>Well, can that. I'm sick of morons who have nothing better to do than to take offence and the idiots that support them. I spent too much time here anyway. I'll just go back to using this resource like the majority. Pity the mods don't consider relative-contribution when acting.</p>
<p>'Tis the way of the world nowadays, I suppose. Form is valued over substance. Those with the power to act are more interested in finding excuses for the inexcusable and have ears only for those who want to make the rules for others.</p>
<p>Oh - here's an example. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/335062/246705"">Not allowed to tell the truth</a> and why I'll not return here until expressly invited.</p>
<p>OK - so I did. The last three paragraphs rang true when I read them again. Truly, a race to the bottom of the worst kind. Any excuse to not do the right thing - excuse those who are up to no good with the flimsiest of excuses - and the moderators in the thick of it. Censorship because I say what the morons in charge don't want to be said, but publish a virus - it's all good!</p>
<p>Let's see how long I'll remain away this time. I'll check back from time to time, but offer solutions or suggestions - no, not any longer. Just sit here and watch the entire shit-heap collapse amongst the protests of those who seek to rule.</p>

My first computer was a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaypro"" rel=""nofollow"">KAYPRO I</a> and later a KAYPRO II (CP/M based machines, not MS-DOS). I still remember thinking, ""what in the world am I going to do with 191kb of storage?"" when double-sided floppies came out. I was a hobbyist programmer, starting with BASIC and Turbo Pascal. When I was in college, I found a love for Organic Chemistry and ended up getting a Masters degree in Chemistry. During graduate school I met a guy that introduced me to his recruiter at Microsoft. I ended up getting job offers from a pharmaceutical company and Microsoft. The offer from Microsoft was too exciting to pass up even though it was less money. I spent ten years at Microsoft, five in Word (SDE) and five in SharePoint (SDET I/II).</p>

<p>I've been in software QA for almost 15 years doing both manual and automated testing. Over the years I've written automation in WordBasic and Word VBA but more recently C# and JavaScript. In the last six months or so at work, we changed our focus to Java and Selenium and I do a little C#/Selenium for tools here and there.</p>

<p>Over the years I've spent a lot of time reading blogs of LOTS of Q&amp;As on SO to learn and improve my knowledge of C#, JavaScript, Java, and Selenium. I don't know what I would have done without it. Reading blogs and articles is great but if you don't already know and/or trust the blogger, you may get bad info. SO isn't bullet proof but it's the only place I know of where you can get rated answers which really helps. There's not much you can't find on SO.</p>

<p>Growing up as a child I went from wanting to be an <strong>astronaut</strong>(<em>Watched Star Trek</em>) to an <strong>archaeologist</strong>(<em>Saw Jurassic Park</em>) to a <strong>marine biologist</strong>(<em>Went to Sea World</em>) and then finally to <strong>game designer</strong> after realizing video games were my favorite activity.</p>

<p>I started out with computers at a young age. My first computer was the commodore 64 and that's where I really grew to love technology, computers, and video games.</p>

<p>I mostly just self taught myself about computers and would spend every last earned dime, combined with Christmas/birthday gifts to build my PC and continue upgrading it.</p>

<p>Later in life I went to school at Full Sail University where I met some of the coolest people ever and learned how hard making video games really is. I also learned how to program, and how to learn pretty much anything I put my mind to in a very short period of time. That is probably the greatest skill I got out of college.</p>

<p>I've worked in the games industry , technical support, and now automation. I really enjoy anything that provides me with a challenge and keeps me learning new things. I really do believe the statement that you never stop being a student.</p>

<p>Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.</p>
<p>Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.</p>
<p>Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.</p>

First using terminals and PET computers (640K RAM and cassette tapes for storage) back in elementary school then moving up to Atari 800 where I did my first programming in basic.  I love it because to me it is like a puzzle to solve but one that can be shaped and formed by my own doing.  I've been doing it for over 30 years now with some breaks into management but never losing that desire to get in and tinker.</p>

<p>Really enjoying learning new things now like Spring Boot, Mongo DB, C++ 11 (ok so I was out of C++ for a while).</p>

<p>Also love to play volleyball.  A great team sport for really understanding how to do a role and understand what everyone else's roles are.</p>

Feel free to <a href=""http://scotthannen.org/about/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ping me</a> or connect with me on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-hannen/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">whatever people connect on</a>, although I primarily do what I can either at work or through this site.</p>

<p>I work primarily with C#, supplemented at times by JavaScript and SQL. Before that I did VB.NET and other things starting with ""VB"" that shouldn't embarrass me but do. The context has been services, websites (MVC and WebForms) and all sorts of other odds and ends in other environments.</p>

<p>While learning new tools and frameworks (Azure, for example) is necessary if I want to actually deliver any software, in more recent years I'm much more interested in the practices and patterns that make code testable, maintainable, and decoupled from concrete implementation details. </p>

<p>One of my favorite books, <a href=""http://cc2e.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Code Complete 2nd Edition</a>, has been around since 2004. I wish I'd known. If you haven't read it, read it. Give a copy to a new programmer. You'll make the world a marginally better place.</p>

<p>If we can't explain something then we don't understand it. So I write blog posts to see how well I understand what I'm learning and to share with others. I used to send my coworkers long emails when I found something interesting, but that's not a great way to communicate. People don't like long emails and they just disappear into the ever-scrolling inbox (or worse.) I'd also like to think that writing from that perspective makes it more accessible to less experienced developers who need really simple examples.</p>

<p>Have you been downvoted? I hate getting downvoted! Here's why <a href=""https://dev.to/scotthannen/negative-stack-overflow-feedback-is-good-for-you-3ac5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">downvotes are good for you</a>.</p>

Sometimes it's making a tool run faster, sometimes it's developing a whole new approach using modern front end technologies.</p>

<p>I started my career as a designer and working my way up to Art Director, won several international design awards. Through some opportunities with other developers I transitioned into development, delivering interactive websites that scored huge wins for my employer's clients. I quickly realized that development is my passion and found my experience and knack for problem-solving translated into a foundational skillset and a thirst for constant learning.</p>

<p>My core language is Javascript, both es5 &amp; es6. git VCS and node/babel/webpack tooling. </p>

<p>I'm now using my skills to develop and maintain internal apps at Compassion Canada, I also am responsible for suggesting and integrating new technologies to improve both the user and development experience.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about new technology, always looking to test new stuff such as programming language, library, smartphone, app, ... I really enjoy discovering new things that can improve my understanding of the world.
In this optic, I have a lot of opinion on a lot of things and I don't hesitate (like ?) to argue on propositions or ideas.</p>

<p>During my formation I have principally learnt through practice which result in some interesting projects that you can find on my github : <a href=""https://github.com/platelk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/platelk</a>
I had some experiences in great companies like Technicolor where I was in the pre-sales team, and a lot of experience linked to Education as teacher or assistant, where I had the chance to really learn the meaning of transmitting your knowledge to different kind of people.</p>

<p>On all my experimentation and projects on web client, server, mobile, software, system administration with different kind of technology like C/C++, Dart, Golang, Python, Java... I have acquired a good understanding of the technological world we live in.
If I had to make a choice, i would prefer server development or machine learning.</p>

I have extensive development experience in C++ and Haskell.  For C++, I hate boost, and so do everything either directly on the standard library or using my own templates.  I write a lot of bash and emacs lisp, too, and at a previous stage of my career turned out a lot of perl (though I haven't used perl in years).  I've dabbled in TeX and written some LaTeX classes used by others, but am far from an expert.  I prefer the command line to all other interfaces, especially web browsers.  I love git as much as I hate github.  I try to write and use free software whenever possible, and have pretty much succeeded on the writing front but am sometimes forced into using proprietary systems (like the baseband on my phone).</p>

My first jobs included writing programs in COBOL, FORTRAN, and RPG II. From there I became LAN/Network Administrator and held jobs with large insurance and utility companies. I acquired solid software skills in modeling and simulation, data encryption, satellite transmission and reception with consulting firms and their emerging technical systems. I am currently an independent contractor.</p>

Instead of developing separate Android and iOS apps now, I just make one Flutter app and compile it down to native code for both platforms. For that reason, I'm not actively maintaining my old Android and iOS answers, so feel free to make updates to them yourself, even to the code (preferably testing that your changes work). I am trying to maintain my Flutter answers, so please leave a comment when you find a mistake or shortcoming.</p>

<p>If possible, <strong>do not</strong> ask here, most of the time it's a waste of time. It'd be <em>much more</em> effective to go to a dedicated forum. But if you still decide to try, remember to tag your question <strong>only</strong> with specific technology tag so that it will only attract genuine domain expert.</p>

<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> tag your question with C++ or C. Those language tags have serious user base problem, they have already become a useless trivia showcase and homework solving center. You don't want to expose your question to unwanted audience, otherwise some <code>i++++</code> parsing ""experts"" incapable of solving <em>a bit</em> of your actual problem will happily nitpick unrelated stuff in your question to show off their ""knowledge"".</p>

<p>Compare this to the female teacher who had sex with an underage boy and she only got a warning. This shows that sexual discrimination happens to both genders but it is currently unfashionable to talk about male discrimination. Until that happens more children will lose their fathers or be put into homes without any family.</p>

<p>My passion is to learn something new to solve complex tasks.
Working in a team of programmers during some of my projects I provided readable, well commented and structured code. I am able to create complex modules and game logic from scratch.</p>
<p>Main skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game Development - <strong>Unity</strong>, <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong></li>
<li>Frontend Development - <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>Vue</strong>, <strong>Three.JS</strong></li>
<li>Backend Development - <strong>.NET</strong>, <strong>Node</strong>, <strong>Express</strong></li>
<li>Desktop App Development - <strong>ElectronJS</strong>, QT</li>
<li>Mobile App Development - <strong>React Native</strong>, <strong>Ionic</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Swift</strong></li>
<li>Version control systems (<strong>Bitbucket</strong>, <strong>GitHub</strong>, <strong>SourceTree</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Google Firebas</strong>e (Firebase Storage, Cloud Messaging, Authentication, Analytics)</li>
<li>AR (<strong>ARFoundation</strong>, <strong>Vuforia</strong>, <strong>ARKit</strong>, <strong>ARCore</strong>, <strong>Wikitude</strong>, ...)</li>
<li>VR (<strong>Oculus Rift/GO</strong>, <strong>HTC Vive</strong>, <strong>Cardboard</strong>, <strong>Gear VR</strong>, <strong>ViroReact</strong> ...)</li>
</ul>
<p>My cooperation with a client is based on revealing and understanding all aspects of the working process for both sides before production. That helps to avoid misunderstanding when work has been already started.</p>
<p>My goal is to provide high-quality service and products to my clients.
After project completion, I will ensure the follow-up support of the project.</p>

<p>Front-end skills: React, Redux, vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS</p>
<p>Backend skills: Node.js, Express.js</p>
<p>Databases: MongoDB</p>
<p>Languages: JavaScript</p>
<p>I love solving other people's problems. It was the pursuit of this love that led me to double major in Psychology and Anthropology and what made the pivot to software engineering an exciting and rewarding one. While I don't use my college degree in a traditional sense, the communication and conflict resolution skills I acquired bring value to any team I'm a part of, as does my ability to see a situation from multiple perspectives at once.</p>
<p>Before switching to a career in software development and engineering, I worked remotely in the transcription industry for a decade. Ever the generalist, I transcribed for companies working on digitizing oral histories, academic research, insurance interviews and investigations, police investigations, captioning work for television shows and extra feature content for feature films, medical dictation... you name it, I've probably transcribed it. I don't list these to brag, but to prove a point. It is mission critical for transcripts to be as accurate as possible. Though it wasn't always easy, I always made it a point to research industry-specific terminology, even going as far as figuring out foreign phrases if they had been used by a speaker to communicate a story (I transcribed a rabbi once who said a phrase in Hebrew and after a bit of sleuthing managed to find a previous talk he'd given where he'd said the same phrase, so that I could include it in the transcript rather than inserting a  tag). Researching, to me, is second nature. I'm the type of person that if someone starts a sentence with &quot;I wonder if...&quot;, if I am not physically restrained from doing so, I'm going to be finding the answer to that query.</p>
<p>This comes in handy in tech, where there are so many problems to solve and while there are some <em>bad</em> solutions to problems, there's no definite <em>good</em> solutions (at least not normally). While I don't know everything, I do have the capacity to figure out anything -- and the passion and drive to go with it.</p>

"14145197","29","2020-08-21 19:44:43","Juliano Suman Curti","2021-05-07 14:23:29","","São Paulo, SP, Brasil","<p>I am currently honing my skills in Java Programming Language at home.
This is a prepartion for taking an Oracle Professional Certification exam.</p>
<p>My short term career goal is to become a Java Back End Developer (junior).
Whereas my long term interest is to dive deep into the role of Back End Developer, or become a Software Engineer.
I have great interest in artificial inteligence. IBM Watson is a great achievement and the world is yet to understand its potencial.
Data science also draws my attention.</p>
<p>As I am new to IT, I will narrow my focus as I work and learn.
Therefore, I can match job's expectations and specialize on the fly.</p>
<p>I am a Civil Engineer by academic formation and by profession. My graduation in Universidade Estatual Paulista (UNESP) at Ilha Solteira/SP was in 2015. In 2020, I would complete 5 years working in the construction industry.
Since I am at the work force, I constructed a number of endevours such as 2 small bridges, land development infrastructure (roads, lighting and drainage), urban sewer systems, sewer treatment plant, and an industrial tower foundation.</p>
<p>I took 6 years to graduate because I got involve in a study abroad program in University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) in Australia. Normally, one takes 10 semestres to graduate, but I did it in 9 (the minimum possible) and took more 3 semestres overseas. I am very proud of that.</p>
<p>While overseas, I worked in a hostel in exchange for housing, participated on the Coogee Beach's LIONS Club and studied hard.</p>
<p>The Brazilian economic depression made the last project which I was involved in end.
I was not able to find a new one for many months. Therefore, I understood it was time to change.
The next good field of working was IT. So, I pivoted my career.</p>
<p>I am respected by the people that worked with me for having a good interpersonal relationship with the team, for having a different perspective on problens, and for being well focused.</p>
<p>I took courses on soft skills this year.
That is because I realized that brazilians do not get encouraged to develop this kind of hability.
So, I started to enhance mine.</p>
<p>When competing in the 3P competition in Australia at UTS, I had a good life experience. An Australian friend of mine taught me about the education they have there so we could overcome a problem the team was having.
That fairplay atitude full of respect toward others marked me since then.</p>
<p>I had the chance to travel to Spain, Italy and China on my way back home from the study abroad program. I planned for the entire year how to save money. I even cooked strogonoff to some chinese friends in the trip.</p>
<p>Be sure that this multicultural deep understanding of beeing human will be with me all times.</p>

<p>My first program was a Turing machine adder, I ran it by hand with paper tape, pen and eraser.</p>
<p>I was lucky to have access to a Honeywell Bull GE-58 mini computer with a 6 digit display, 10000 octets of core memory and a couple of 2.4 MB hard drives. It needed 15KW of electrical power.

<li>I write everything down</li>
<li>I am the last to leave</li>

<p>Somehow, I found myself in a position where I had to manage a team of programmers and other people who were more skilled than me. At that point I realized that in order for me to be effective in my role and to have my co-worker's respect, I had to learn how to code and use their tools.</p>

<p>My background in mathematics helped me to teach myself c++, linux, bash, powershell, mysql, php, javascript, html. </p>

<p>Little did I know programming would become such a passion, and a career that I enjoy. I am thankful I discovered it. </p>

<h1>OS architect. Cyber expert. Software Developer. Researcher.</h1>

<p>Welcome to my world –</p>

<hr>

<p>I love developing, designing and securing software.</p>

<p>I love multitude of software domains – Android / Linux based Firmware (ROM) development, communication protocols, mobile apps, Cyber, IOT &amp; embedded, and I had the priviliege to gain deep experience in each through out my 19 and some year old career – beginning as a programming officer at IDF, continuing as a Senior Software engeneer in a number of Israeli high tech companies &amp; Startups, then building and leading my own software teams at companies I started. Today I simply enjoy the joy of code from my home office located in the town of Tzur Yizhak in Israel.</p>

<p>I enjoy the challenge of research. It started when I began my academic career at the age of 16, continued with my Masters Thesis in the field of DCSPs (Distributed Constraints Satisfaction Problems), and then went to Cyber, IOT and bioinformatics. I love learning new fields, finding new ways of solving interesting problems.</p>

<p>Integrity. Courage. Joy. These are my core values. This is who I am as a person. These values are part of me as I create software, work with customers, deliver products, meet people. This is what you’ll meet working with me.</p>
